This  afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and important members  of the crew. Tonight we invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home  away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many  memorable meals in The Restaurant.<strong> </strong><br />\n  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 2 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Today is a day to relax on deck or peruse an array of titles and  topics in the well-stocked Library. A mandatory Zodiac briefing will take place  during the day. As we sail towards Cuba, guests can join the Expedition Team on  the outer decks and watch for birds, whales and dolphins, or head to The  Theatre to learn about Cuba and its unique culture and history -as Christopher  Columbus said: “the most beautiful land that eyes have ever seen”.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Days 3-4 — Havana,  Cuba </strong><br />\n  La Habana is the largest city in Cuba. The Historical Centre of  Havana is characterized by the presence of the architectural trends of the  Baroque and the Eclecticism, which is the fingerprint of the Spanish settling. </p>\n<p>After clearance procedures, you have the opportunity to enjoy a  guided tour taking in the highlights of Havana. We will start our journey to  the metropolitan and Modern Havana driving to the military fortress Castillo de  Los Tres Santos Reyes del Morro, from where we will have a commanding view over  the city. We will then continue to the Revolution Square, a memorial to the  Cuban independence hero Jose Marti. From there we drive to the colonial part of  the city to explore Havana by foot through the Historical Centre of Old Havana,  declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, visiting the Cathedral Square, the Plaza  de Armas, Havana’s first University San Geronimo de la Habana, and the General  Captain’s Palace. We will have an opportunity to enjoy a drink at La Taberna  while listening to a live band playing some typical and traditional Cuban music.&nbsp; From there we will walk back to the port and  ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After an early dinner onboard <em>Silver  Explorer</em>, we set out to enjoy a typical not-to-miss Havana Tropicana Show.  This place is the most famous and important parties’ room in Havana and it was  founded in 1937 upon an idea of a tropical version of the Folies Bergère. The  luxurious and spectacular show, performed under the stars, offers Caribbean  music and all the varieties related with the cabaret ambiance. Sample some  local rum (and coke) while enjoying this unforgettable performance –mind you,  as cigars are offered to every guest attending the show (some 1000 seats are  available) a lot of smoking will take place! As this is an open air arena it is  weather depending –rain will cancel the show. As the show begins at 10 p.m.,  the return to <em>Silver Explorer</em> will be  at about 01 a.m. …</p>\n<p><em>Silver Explorer</em> will overnight  in the port of Havana. </p>\n<p>During our second day in Havana, we depart for a tour to see,  sample and enjoy three things Cuba is famous for: vintage American cars,  cigars, and <em>mojitos</em>. Join us on a  drive in vintage American cars to the ‘Cigar Factory’. Learn about the history  of cigars and see how Cuban cigars are hand-rolled, (the purchase of cigars and  rum will be possible at the end of the visit) before we continue our drive  through the residential areas of Miramar and Vedado to the National Hotel, one  of the most famous hotels in Cuba. You will see the garden and history hall and  will have time for THE Cuban cocktail: a <em>mojito</em>.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to explore Havana on your own, the “Havana Rum  Museum” is in walking distance and has guided tours explaining the process and  history of rum and the Havana Rum company.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Punta  Frances, Isle of Youth, Cuba </strong><br />\n  During the morning attend one of the lectures or food seminars  relating to Cuba or enjoy the cruise along Cuba’s western tip before reaching  the “Isle of Youth”. This enchanting island was discovered by Columbus in 1494  during his second America voyage, set in the Canarreos Archipelago, between  Cuba and Mexico. It served over centuries as a base for English and French  pirates, who were after the Spanish galleons richly loaded with gold and silver  from South America to Europe. In the 16th century, Sir Francis Drake used this  island as a pirate-base. Only a few years ago chests filled with gold coins and  numerous shipwrecks were discovered from times of the Spanish conquerors in the  south of the island. Now officially known as the Isle of Youth, it is also  called \"The Treasure Island\", after Robert Louis Stevenson’s famous  novel. </p>\n<p>We will tender ashore at the Punta Frances Maritime National Park.  The underwater world of this maritime national park is a must-see. Enjoy  snorkelling, swimming or sunbathing. Join our onboard Marine Biologist for a snorkel  tour and learn to identify damselfish, jacks, surgeonfish, trumpet fish, parrot  fish, triggerfish and turtles. Alternatively, explore more of this National  Park by foot and be on the look out for iguanas and pelicans.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Cienfuegos,  Cuba </strong><br />\n  Cienfuegos (“hundred fires”) is Cuba’s city with an exceptional  colonial flavour. The city was founded in the early 19th century by French  colonists and has been called <em>The Pearl  of the South.</em> Its second nickname has been <em>Cuban Paris</em>, this last name because of its French influence and having  its own <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. UNESCO  declared it as a World Cultural Heritage Site in 2005 as the best example of  the 19th century implementation of new ideas in modernity, hygiene and order in  Latin American urban planning.</p>\n<p>On our tour we will visit the nearby city of Trinidad. Founded by  Diego Velázquez in 1515 as Villa de la Santísima Trinidad, it still preserves  its colonial style: cobble-stoned streets, tiled roofs, the filigree of its  grilles and inner patios remain from colonial times. It was declared a UNESCO World  Cultural Heritage in 1988. We will visit the Romantic Museum and the Brunet  Palace before having lunch at the Plaza Mayor. After lunch, we will visit La  Canchánchara tavern where you can sample a special drink made with honey, lemon  and rum. It was originally given to slaves as a salve in Colonial times.</p>\n<p>For those wishing to visit the town of Cienfuegos during the  afternoon, a shuttle bus will be available.</p>\n<p><strong>Day  7 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  A day at sea always gives good  opportunities to assess the things seen so far and to prepare one for the  different destinations still to be visited. Help our birders spot some of the  seabirds found far away from their nesting grounds. A refreshing drink and an  interesting book can be good company too. There are many ways to enjoy the day  while <em>Silver Explorer</em> cruises the  Caribbean.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 8 — Santiago  de Cuba, Cuba </strong><br />\n  Cuba’s second largest city will reveal its most intriguing sites  today. We will drive through the main streets of Santiago de Cuba on our way to  the Morro Castle, originally called “Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca”.  Designed in 1637, this fortress at the entrance to the bay and harbour of Santiago  de Cuba was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage list as “the most complete  and best-preserved example of Spanish-American military architecture, based on  Italian and Renaissance design principles” in 1997. Ample time will be given to  explore the site. </p>\n<p>A brief stop is made at the Revolution Square before we intend to  visit Santa Ifigenia Cemetery and the Cuban independence hero’s mausoleum. Before  heading to Céspedes Park, the heart of the city, where Santiago’s beautiful  Cathedral overlooks the square, a stop will be made at <em>Caney’s Bar Rum</em>, related to a famous brand that has a bat in its  logo. The last stop will be at Céspedes Park. This will give you an overview of  the city, should you wish to explore at your own leisure.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, leave Santiago de Cuba on an excursion that will  take the road to La Gran Piedra, one of the Sierra Maestra Peaks. There you  will be able to admire wonderful views of the coast and surrounding  countryside. 459 steps (with the last steps up an iron ladder!) will have to be  climbed to achieve the best view from La Gran Piedra (subject to weather  conditions), but there are areas to catch your breath when needed during the  ascent. Later we will visit the Isabelica Museum – an old coffee plantation  founded in the early 19th century, complete with original coffee drying floors  and a museum depicting the early coffee industry. We will also visit the  Botanical Gardens, with its large variety of indigenous plants and flowers.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 –</strong><strong> At Sea</strong><br />\n  A  leisurely day at sea allows time to exchange notes with fellow travellers and to  recap our stay in Cuba with our Expedition Team. Take advantage of the  luxurious amenities aboard <em>Silver Explorer</em>.  Attend a lecture about Cartagena and its role during the Spanish colonial  times, or relax in the comfort of your suite and watch a movie on the in-suite  interactive television.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Cartagena,  Colombia </strong><br />\n  Since its founding in 1533 by Francisco de Heredia, Cartagena de  Indias has been one of the most important ports of Spanish South America.  Almost all maritime traffic from South America’s west coast to Spain via Panama  went on to Cartagena awaiting galleons and convoys to Europe.<br />\n  As a result Cartagena has been attacked repeatedly by pirates. The  old city had therefore been surrounded by several fortifications and walls  –making it one of the most fortified cities in South America in its time. It  was so well defended that even the British navy was not able to conquer it in  1741 –despite the fact that that the British had the largest fleet ever  assembled to that point.<br />\n  Cartagena celebrates that it was the first Colombian city to  declare independence from Spain in 1811.<br />\n  The old part of Cartagena is still enclosed by extensive walls and  ‘protected’ by several fortresses. This part is known as “the walled city” and  was declared a Colombian Heritage Site in 1959, while UNESCO declared it a  World Cultural Heritage Site in 1984.</p>\n<p>During the afternoon we will visit the walled part of Cartagena  with its colonial houses, narrow streets, many galleries and restaurants.  Inside this protected area are the Museum of the Inquisition, the Museo de Oro  (Gold Museum), and the Museum of Modern Art, as well as the Film Museum, the  Naval Museum, and the imposing Teatro Heredia. Opposite the walled city is the  impressive fortress ‘Castillo de San Felipe Barajas’ with the statue of its  defender against the Royal Navy in 1741.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 11 — San  Blas Islands, Panama </strong><br />\n  We will board our Zodiacs and visit one of the 365 islets and  islands off Panama’s northern coast. Formerly known as the San Blas  Archipelago, the islands and the coastal land belonging to the Guna ethnic  group received its new (and local) name of Guna Yala (formerly written as Kuna  Yala) in 2011.<br />\n  The approximately 30,000 Guna live along the Caribbean coast and  on 36 of the islands. They live off fishing and agriculture. The islanders  leave on canoes for the mainland to plant and harvest there, as the islands are  only used for housing. The women are quite famous for the handicraft they  produce, of which the best known are the “mola” –embroidered designs worn  mainly by the women. The geometrical designs were originally painted onto the  bodies, but were eventually transferred onto cloth and used as adornments for  shirts. Birds, fish, scenes of the local life and even modern influences can be  depicted this way and are a favourite souvenir. </p>\n<p>We will want to visit one of the uninhabited islets for swimming  and snorkelling. While we will be there, local women will come over from the  other islands, showing us their molas –which not only make for good photos but  are nice and sought-after souvenirs (for you to purchase, if you so wish).</p>\n<p>Tonight our onboard Videographer/Photographer will present the Voyage-DVD,  recapturing all the interesting moments we have had and the interesting sites  seen on this voyage. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 —</strong> <strong>Colon, Panama</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer.</em></p>\n<p><em>Expedition  highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be  guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure  opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into  account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity. Expedition Team members  scheduled for this voyage are subject to change or cancellation.</em></p>",

This evening, after  settling in and participating in a mandatory safety drill, we will be setting  sail. Your Expedition Leader will then introduce important members of the crew  and the Expedition Team. Tonight we invite you to familiarise yourself with  your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the  first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.<br />\n  We will relocate to the entrance of the Panama  Canal, waiting for the beginning of our transit the following morning.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 2 — Panama Canal, Panama<br />\n  </strong>Today we pass through the narrowest part of the Isthmus of Panama and the  American continent. Mules had been used as a means of transport for centuries  before a railroad was constructed in the mid-1850s. When Nicaragua and Colombia  (of which Panama was a part at that time) were selected as possible sites for a  canal, a French company began excavations in the 1880s but was thwarted by  engineering problems and tropical disease, which killed over 20,000 workers. In  1903 the United States took over the project, completing it in 1914. <br />\n  The Panama Canal is an engineering marvel  connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. Three sets of locks work as  water elevators lifting ships to the level of Gatun Lake, 85 feet (26 metres)  above sea level, and later lowering them again to sea level on the other side.  By using the Canal, vessels avoid travelling the 14,000 nautical mile route  through the treacherous Drake Passage and around Cape Horn at the southernmost  tip of South America.<br />\n  By the time we intend to use the Canal a new  set of locks has been operational since June 26, 2016. With this third set of  locks accomplished and by raising the level of Lake Gatun by just 40  centimetres (slightly less than 16 inches) 1,100 additional transits per year  can be achieved.<br />\n  <br />\n  NOTE: Although we have requested and booked a day-time transit, due to heavy  traffic in the Canal, a daylight transit cannot be guaranteed. Confirmation of  exact times will be established once we get close to our actual transit date.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 3 — Bay of San Miguel, Darien  Jungle, Panama<br />\n  </strong>The Darien Jungle is remote and has one of the most diverse ecosystems in  the world. This morning,&nbsp;<em>Silver Explorer&nbsp;</em>will anchor in the  Bay of San Miguel. We will explore this pristine, seldom visited area by Zodiac  or local canoe, navigating up the tidal Mogue River. At the conclusion of our  river adventure, we hear the sound of distant drums welcoming us to the remote  Embera Village. The Darien Jungle is rarely visited by outsiders (fewer than  1,000 tourists visit each year), and the Embera are one of several indigenous  groups that live in relative isolation.&nbsp;<br />\n  <br />\n  We will go ashore to melodic rhythms of traditional tribal music played by male  villagers on drums, maracas and flutes. Local women and children in brightly  coloured attire welcome us to their village and introduce us to their way of  life. We will visit authentic tribal dwellings built of nearby trees and  plants. Before leaving, villagers will perform a native dance for our  entertainment and demonstrate basket weaving and carving techniques. If you are  adventurous you might even get temporal mosquito-repellent painted onto your  body (careful –the dark markings stay for at least two weeks). And we will have  the opportunity to purchase souvenirs, including beautiful handcrafted baskets  and carvings.<br />\n  As the Darien Jungle is recognised as one of  the world’s top ten birding sites, on our way to the village and back to <em>Silver Explorer</em> we hope to see many different  bird species such as the colourful Crimson-collared Tanager, Green and Chestnut-fronted  Macaws, Rufous-tailed and Snow-bellied Hummingbirds, whimbrels, White Ibises  and egrets, as well as Laughing Gulls. Other wildlife we may see includes  vultures and the endangered Great Curassow.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Special Request</strong><br />\n  When preparing for your Silversea Expedition, we encourage you to purchase and  pack a donation of school supplies. Much-needed items include pens, pencils,  writing pads, reading material, and new or second-hand clothes for children  ages 1 to 12 years old. The village is also always in need of prescription  reading glasses, over-the-counter medicine and medical equipment. Donations  will be collected on board by the Expedition Team and distributed to the local  villagers during our visit as part of our cultural exchange.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 4 — Bahia Solano and Utria National Natural  Park, Colombia<br />\n  </strong>Today, we arrive in Bahia Solano, where we will anchor offshore and be  brought to land by local tender or Zodiac. Bahía Solano is quite isolated;  connected to the outside world by a single, small local airport. Tucked inside  a beautiful bay, the small Columbian town is lined by the Pacific Ocean on one  side and thick, impenetrable jungle on the other. The majority of the 10,000  residents work in local industries, which are predominantly fishing,  agriculture and eco-tourism.<br />\n  If you select the Bahia Solano Town Tour with  your own local guide, the tour begins at the local secondary school, where you  will be welcomed by the children. Afterwards, take a relaxed walk through the  community, wandering the streets with their array of different shops and  businesses, visiting the main church, the primary school and library, before  visiting the small fishing port where there will be a small display of the  locally caught fish, which are flown out daily to the main cities of Colombia.  The tour ends on the <em>malecon</em> or seafront,  with a performance of Afro-Pacific and Indigenous Colombian dance and an  artisans’ market where handicrafts might be available for sale. <br />\n  During lunch, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will relocate to Ensenada Nuqui, Utría National Natural  Park.<br />\n  Our explorations of the Colombian Pacific coast  continue with a visit to Utria National Natural Park. From coral reefs and  mangroves to the marine environment, tropical rainforest and rocky beaches  where sea turtles come to lay their eggs, few places in the world encompass the  diversity of Utría’s ecosystems. The Expedition Team will offer a choice of  trail hikes. Three hundred and eighty species of birds have been recorded and the  park has several important species of timber trees, notably the area’s beloved  Cohiba tree and the Oquendo tree, which is used in the creation of local art  and handicrafts. Utria National Park is also home to groups of Embera, related  to the Darien Jungle Embera we visited in Panama.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 5 — Utría National Natural Park,  Colombia<br />\n  </strong>Our exploration of Utria National Natural Park continues. Again today the  Expedition Team will offer a choice of trail hikes to explore the park’s  numerous highlights. During our walk, we hope to see some of Utría’s great  variety of animal life, which includes deer, pecaris, anteaters, black howler  and spider monkeys, wild cats (such as jaguar, puma and ocelot), sloths, and  some rodent species. <br />\n  Depending on the tides we might explore the  mangroves using local boats or Zodiacs or simply use the walkways. <br />\n  Apart from the animals ashore this part of the  Colombian coast is recognized as a prime spot to observe humpback whales from  June to November. Sperm whales and orcas are occasional visitors, while bottlenose  dolphins can be seen all year round. The park’s waters are known to have 11  types of coral and more than 180 species of fish –even whale sharks are on  record.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 6 — Cruising the North Pacific Ocean<br />\n  </strong>After our exploration in Colombia we have a day at sea. As strange as it  may sound, we will be cruising the North Pacific Ocean –we are still north of  the Equator. <br />\n  Our lecture team will offer several interesting  and enlightening talks about natural history and the cultures that inhabit this  part of South America. Perhaps the story of Francis Drake, his voyages and the  connection with Isla de la Plata is something you might want to hear. Join the  Expedition Team in The Theatre or Panorama Lounge, or relax on the Sun Deck,  savouring some local drinks or cocktails. <br />\n  During the night, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will head into the Southern Hemisphere –Neptune  permitting….<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 7 — Isla de la Plata, Ecuador<br />\n  </strong>Exploration and discovery await us as we anchor off the coast of the  uninhabited and unspoilt Isla de la Plata (Island of Silver). The island’s name  was derived from the legend of swashbuckling pirate Sir Francis Drake’s buried  silver treasure. The popular legend states that in the 16th century, hundreds  of tons of silver and gold were never fully recovered and are still hidden on  the island. <br />\n  The island was privately owned until 1979, when  it was declared part of Ecuador's Machalilla National Park. Best known for its  fauna, which is amazingly similar to that of the Galapagos Islands, Isla de la  Plata is a good place for birding, photography and long nature walks. Although  just south of the equator, the influences of the colder Humboldt Current bring  nutrient-rich water as far north as Isla de la Plata. Together with our local  natural history guides, we will go ashore and enjoy various walks, watching for  herons, pelicans, gulls, frigatebirds, Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Boobies,  and possibly Waved Albatrosses and hawks.&nbsp;<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 8 — Machala, Ecuador</strong><br />\n  Machala, with a population of approximately 250,000 inhabitants, is called the  “Capital of the Banana” as the ‘World Fair of the Banana’ is held there during  the third week of September. Producers and buyers from Perú, Costa Rica,  Colombia, Venezuela, México, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, Argentina, Guatemala,  Panamá, República Dominicana, El Salvador, Honduras and, obviously, Ecuador  will show up . Fortunately for us, there is more to Machala than just bananas:<br />\n  Today you have three options: you can either  visit the Buenaventura cloud forest reserve with its staggering amount of  hummingbirds and possible sightings of the rare Long-wattled Umbrellabird, or  visit the Arenillas Reserve, a “dry forest”, mainly looking at botany. If you  like extremes, the Puyango Petrified Forest might be more to your liking: it is  one of the largest petrified forests in the world –located within a lush  tropical forest- and involves a bit of walking uphill and downhill.<br />\n  Since Machala is also known for several typical  dishes, mostly seafood -from raw marinated shrimp to shrimp soup and fried  shrimp; and from fried bananas to fish soup, all excursions will have some  sample of local refreshments. <br />\n  Tonight our onboard Videographer will present  the Voyage-DVD, letting you reminiscence all those extraordinary moments and  encounters during your voyage.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 9 — Guayaquil, Ecuador</strong><em><br />\n    Silver Explorer</em> will arrive in port in the early morning. Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.<br />\n  <br />\n  <em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only  and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together  to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible,  taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice  conditions.

Since bananas and plantains are very  important in Ecuador’s cuisine, Chef Antonio will present the various uses for  banana and plantain. </p><p>A special  Ecuadorian-themed Captain’s Dinner will be served this evening.</p><p><b>Day 3 —  Cruise &amp; Explore Isla Lobos de Tierra, Peru</b><br />  Lobos  De Tierra and Lobos de Afuera are steep and rocky islands that protrude more  than 61 metres from the surface of the deep blue Pacific, offering us a  splendid opportunity to explore with our Zodiacs. Sea lions and hundreds of  Blue-footed Boobies can be viewed ashore, whilst Peruvian Pelicans pass  overhead. We will attempt to make a landing on the island.<br />  During the afternoon,  Chef Antonio will introduce you to the wonderful world of chocolate –enjoy a  spectacular tasting of various chocolate specialties.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Salaverry and Isla Guañape,  Peru</b><br />  This morning we  explore the main religious centre of the Mochica culture.

Enjoy his special signature  Choco-dinner!</p><p><b>Day 5 — Callao, Peru</b><br />  Our exploration takes  us to the Larco Herrera Museum, an extensive private collection of pre-Incan  ceramics –probably the largest collection of its kind in the world- providing  an excellent overview on 3000 years of development of Peruvian pre-Columbian  history. Apart from the finest gold and silver collections of Ancient Peru, it  also houses the famous erotic archaeological collection, one of the most  visited Peruvian attractions.<br />  We will then proceed  to the district of Miraflores, where we will visit the Huaca Pucllana ruins.  This ceremonial centre of the Lima culture developed between the years 200 and  700 AD. Multiple tombs have been found in this adobe pyramid, which in modern  times has been completely surrounded by the neighbourhood of Miraflores. <br />  In the evening, we  will enjoy the magnificent setting of the Huaca Pucllana Restaurant which  overlooks the ruins lit at night for a special Peruvian dinner and some of the  outstanding South American wines Peru and its neighbouring countries produce. <br />  After this unique  culinary experience, we return to the port of Callao.</p><p><b>Day  6 — Paracas, and Ballestas Islands, Peru</b><br />  Nazca Lines Overflight<br />  During  a special Silversea Expedition complimentary excursion to see the famous Nazca Lines from the air,  the Nazca Desert will reveal  a series of famous geoglyphs stretching for miles along the Pacific coast.<br />  Dating back to an era between 200BC and 700AD, these mysterious figures and  geometric patterns are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The lines show an  understanding of sophisticated mathematics and surveying techniques.<br />  After  this special experience of over-flying the Nazca Lines, we will head to the  beautiful Hotel Paracas, where we will enjoy a very comprehensive and  interesting Pisco Tasting. In a shaded area and overlooking the Pacific Ocean,  a Pisco expert will present 5 different types of Pisco. Apart from learning  about Pisco you will obviously get to taste Peru’s (and Chile’s) national drink  and counterbalance the drinks with some local appetizers. <br />  If you do not want to  see the Nazca Lines, then explore the Ballestas Islands -one of this  region’s most beautiful natural attractions. Sea lions, cormorants, Blue-footed  Boobies, terns, pelicans and Humboldt Penguins can all be expected around the  Ballestas Islands. Because of Peruvian regulations this excursion can only be  done in local boats and landings are not allowed. </p><p>This evening, you  will be introduced to your Peruvian culinary expert who will join the next  section of our voyage of culinary discovery.</p><p><b>Day 7 — At Sea</b><br />  Gather in The Theatre  to hear fascinating tales of adventure or to learn about the region’s wildlife  and remarkable nature. <br />  Due to the presence  of the very nutrient-rich Humboldt Current, the waters along the Peruvian coast  are incredibly rich in fish life. Today our chefs will introduce you to the  world of “ceviche” in all its forms.</p><p>This evening we will have  a special Peruvian-themed dinner.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Matarani, Peru</b><br />  This morning we will  drive to Arequipa, “The White City”. Join our experts for a walking tour of the  UNESCO Historical Centre including the Plaza de Armas and the Cathedral,  followed by a guided visit of Santuarios Andinos, home to the Sarita and  Juanita mummies. Found close to the summit of a nearby mountain, they were likely  a sacrifice to an Incan god. </p><p>We will then head  over to the Dominican Santa Catalina Monastery -one of the most important and  impressive religious monuments in Peru. The complex is huge and fascinating; it  is almost a city within the city. We will undertake a guided tour of this  impressive monastery. </p><p>Later the refectory  of the monastery will be especially reserved for our group while we enjoy a  three-course lunch accompanied by live music featuring Andean folk songs.</p><p>This evening, our  Peruvian chefs will feature regional fare, and especially potatoes and other  tubers. Peru has more than 1000 varieties of potatoes…</p><p><b>Day 9 — Arica, Chile</b><br />  An  early morning departure is necessary for our journey to explore the region’s  unique Altiplano scenery. We will see important archaeological sites along the  way. A  stop will be made at a rustic Inn to have a coca leaf tea to avoid feeling sick  because of the altitude, before continuing to a location near Socoroma village  where lunch will be served in a special catering service exclusive for  Silversea guests. The location is set in the middle of what used to be an  ancient Inca road, with a privileged view of the valley and the Socoroma  village where you will have the opportunity to taste some local Andean flavours.  Driving on, the landscape suddenly opens up and the wide valley of Putre can be  seen beneath massive, snow-capped peaks. Upon our arrival in Putre, we will  stroll through town together at a leisurely pace, visiting the church and  watching a performance of Andean folklore in the main plaza. <br />  Alternatively, enjoy  a visit to the Lauca National Park. This is a challenging excursion, taking you  to an altitude of 4,500 metres. From the pier we drive to the Quebrada de  Cardones, a gorge known for its spectacular views and 20-foot high candelabra  cacti. Driving past Putre, we will reach Chungará Lake to admire the mountains  reflected in the lake. During one hour at the lake, we will look for the many  local bird species, among them the Chilean Flamingo. During the stay at the lake,  a box lunch will be served. On the return we will stop at the abandoned  pre-Hispanic village of Parinacota, a National Monument.</p><p>After these strenuous  excursions take your time to join the bar team for a Pisco evening. Learn more  about this iconic drink and whether this is an original Peruvian or Chilean  drink.</p><p><b>Day 10 — At Sea</b><br />  A leisurely day at  sea is yours to enjoy. Participate in discussions and onboard activities led by  the Expedition Team and join our chefs for a ceviche workshop, preparing your  own ceviche for lunch –our chefs will assist you in creating your own masterpiece.</p><p>Then relax in one of  the lounges with that book you’ve been meaning to read and meet up with new  friends for cocktails. Before turning in for the night, take a stroll on deck  to take in the solitude of the vast sea and sky.</p><p><b>Day 11 — Antofagasta, Chile</b><br />  Visit  the Atacama Desert — one of the driest places on earth. Depart early for the  seven-hour ride and two choices: The first option is to visit the charming  adobe village of San Pedro, to have a leisurely lunch and to explore the quaint  handicraft market, the church –a National Historic Monument- and the narrow  streets of the village, before finally heading to see the Valle de la Luna. <br />  The  other option includes a quick lunch in San Pedro de Atacama and a drive towards  the immense Atacama Salt Flat with its splendid geological formations and its  most famous residents — the pink flamingos. <br />  Both  options will head to the Valle de la Luna. In this unique lunar landscape we  will see numerous rock formations jutting out of the sand, eroded by wind into  incredible shapes. At a lookout, we will enjoy observing an indigenous ritual  to Mother Earth (Pachamama).<br />  Alternatively, a half-day  city tour is available. Antofagasta is a refined blend of traditional Chilean  town and British colonial city. We will see the Huanchaca Ruins and during a  walking tour will visit the Plaza Colón and the Regional Museum with its  overview of the saltpetre industry and how it affected the region. The final destination  will be La Portada, an enormous rock caressed by the sea and sand until a giant  arch formed. </p><p><b>Day 12 — Isla Pan de Azucar, Chile</b><br />  Silversea’s very own  culinary star and Culinary Director Rudi Scholdis will join us for the  remainder of our voyage. Before lunch, Rudi and our Chilean sommelier will  introduce you to the delights of Chilean wine and seafood. <br />  This afternoon we  explore the rugged shores of Isla Pan de Azucar (or Sugarloaf Island) by  Zodiac. The island is home to thousands of Humboldt Penguins. During our Zodiac  cruise along the perimeter of Isla Pan de Azucar, we also hope to encounter  Kelp Gulls, Turkey Vultures, Blackish Oystercatchers, and Peruvian Boobies,  pelicans, sea lions and the reclusive South American marine otter.</p><p><b>Day 13 — Isla Chañaral, Chile</b><br />  This morning, our  culinary team will focus on shellfish and other seafood and the various ways to  prepare these in a workshop. From raw to steamed –find your preferred dish  accompanied with the perfect Chilean wine.</p><p>During the afternoon,  we will explore the islands that make up the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve  by Zodiac. The islands are an important breeding site for Humboldt Penguins. We  also hope to see groups of sea lions resting on the rocky cliff ledges, South  American marine otters sliding in and out of the waters along the coastline,  and playful bottlenose dolphins in the surrounding seas.</p><p><b>Day 14 — Coquimbo, Chile </b><br />  Today  you have two choices: a morning visit to the Elqui Valley or a longer visit to  the Limarí Valley.<br />  For  the morning excursion we follow the coast to drive into the Elqui Valley, an  important agricultural area for papayas, olives, pears and custard apples. This  is also where muscatel grapes are turned into Pisco, Chile’s national spirit.<br />  We  will visit the small and picturesque artist village of Diaguitas and explore  its arid and attractive streets. At a local workshop you will have the  opportunity to buy handmade crafts featuring the stunning and beautiful  Diaguita designs and iconography.  <br />  Afterwards  we will drive to Vicuña. Famous for its many Pisco producers it was also home  to Chilean’s Nobel Prize winner in literature, Gabriela Mistral. We will visit  the Plaza and the Bauer Tower and will have time to explore independently  before returning back to Coquimbo and <em>Silver  Explorer</em> for lunch.<br />  The  other excursion will take us into the Limarí Valley, slightly further south.  Known for its pictographs and petroglyphs of the El Molle culture, we will  visit the Enchanted Valley in the vicinity of the town of Ovalle. The Elqui and  Limarí Valleys are rich and fertile transversal valleys running across the  coastal mountains, leading to their importance as agricultural areas. Grapes  are grown in impressive vineyards for export and for wine and we will visit the  Tabalí winery. Starting in the early 1990s, already in its first year of production  Tabalí obtained 24 medals. This vineyard is well known for its unique coupages  and blends of wine stocks such as Viognier, Sangiovese and Carmenere. A guided  tour of the winery will be given, followed by a tasting of its most  representative wines.<br />  We  will then continue to a local restaurant for a typical Chilean lunch of  empanadas and an <em>asado</em> (a BBQ),  before returning to the pier. <br />  Our  last night aboard will permit us to celebrate our new culinary skills and  appreciation for the epicurean delights of South America’s West Coast. Our  chefs will prepare a menu that will reflect the lands we have travelled through  with selections from each region visited.</p><p><b>Day 15 — Valparaiso, Chile</b><br /><em>Silver  Explorer</em> will arrive in  Valparaiso in the morning. Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver  Explorer</em><em>.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><em>Expedition  highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be  guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure  opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into  account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice conditions.

This  evening, after a mandatory safety briefing, you will be introduced to your  Expedition Team and enjoy the first of many delightful dinners in The  Restaurant. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 </strong><strong>—</strong><strong> At Sea</strong> <br />\n  A leisurely day at sea is yours to enjoy. Meet some of your fellow  explorers as you discover the luxurious amenities aboard <em>Silver Explorer</em>. Attend informative lectures and attend a Zodiac briefing led by your Expedition Team members  that will prepare you for the upcoming ports-of-call and the many adventures  that lie ahead. In the comfort of your suite, relax and watch a movie on the  in-suite interactive television.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 —  Niebla, Chile </strong><br />\n  Niebla is a small village on the banks of  the Rio Valdivia where Chile’s Corral Bay meets the Pacific Ocean. Today  Niebla is a beach resort, but in 1671 it was a defensive fortress built by Spanish  conquerors to prevent attacks from pirates and corsairs. The various batteries  and garrisons on land and on Isla Mancera formed the most fortified complex  along South America’s West coast.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>This morning we will drive to the charming  river port city of Valdivia, where we will find an interesting blend of  influences from the native Mapuche, Spanish settlers, and German immigrants.  Valdivia is also known because of the 1960 earthquake –the worst ever recorded  and the strongest in the last 110 years. On our drive to Valdivia we can see  tracts of land that are still under water as a result of the quake. Our  destination is the Historical and  Anthropological Museum Maurice Van der Maele that houses a collection of  Mapuche artefacts and jewellery, as well as important pieces from Hispanic and  German periods. The first German colonists arrived here in 1849 and  worked hard to develop Valdivia into one of southern Chile’s most productive  areas and their influence can be felt in every  corner of this city.</p>\n<p>During the afternoon, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will head further south, giving our lecturers time  to introduce you to the natural and historical highlights of Chile’s Lake  District. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 —  Puerto Montt, Chile </strong><br />\n  Puerto Montt is the starting point for our  excursions to the Lake District and specifically Lago Llanquihue and Lago Todos  los Santos, also known as the Emerald Lake. </p>\n<p>We will drive along the southern shore of  Chile’s second largest lake and head for the Petrohué waterfalls. These falls  ‘connect’ both lakes and we will walk over to the viewing platforms of Chile’s  best-known falls. Here we will have an opportunity to see some of the local  plants and endemic trees. Later we will take a local boat onto Lago Esmeralda  from where you will have excellent views (weather permitting) of Volcán Osorno  (a ‘twin’ of Japan’s Mount Fuji). Later we will have lunch at a lakeside  restaurant and will drive to Puerto Varas where a walk will reveal not only impressive  views of Lago Llanquihue and the surrounding area, but also why this is called  the “city of Roses”.<br />\n  If you want to see more of the local life,  head for the Petrohué Falls and later visit a typical local farm, Fundo  Olguita. At this Chilean  horse stud farm see the animals, riding gear, and a demonstration of Chilean  rodeo. Lunch includes the influence of two cultures: a tasty barbecue with  traditional German desserts in honor of the family's German roots. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 </strong><strong>— </strong><strong>Castro, </strong><strong>Chiloé  Island, </strong><strong>Chile </strong><br />\n  Chiloé Island is home to an amazing  collection of 150 Jesuit-influenced wooden churches, houses raised up on poles  out of the water, and more than 400 native plant varieties. We drop anchor and  go ashore via the Zodiacs. </p>\n<p>From Castro, we head north to the  picturesque village of Dalcahue. On the  way, glimpse the colourful hamlet of Llaullao with houses roofed with <em>tejuelas</em>. After a brief ferry ride to Quinchao, we pass  through Curaco de Velez. This tiny village of approximately 500  inhabitants had its best times around 1850 when cattle raisers and whalers  lived here. Today, beautiful houses remain as a testament to these better  times. Just ahead, we arrive in Achao,  which was founded by the Jesuits in 1743 and now has almost  2,500 inhabitants. Achao is a lively town with boats arriving every day from  all the surrounding islands. While  here, we will visit the Jesuit’s Achao Church, the oldest wooden structure in  Chiloé and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Constructed in 1730, it contains  beautiful baroque imagery.  Afterwards, we cross Achao’s main square to enjoy a snack and typical local  music before returning to Dalcahue. Here we will visit the well-preserved Dalcahue  Church with its galvanized iron roof. Carved by Jesuits from locally grown  Patagonian cypress, larch and luma trees, the detailing and precision are  amazing. It  was declared a World Heritage site in 2000.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, visit an area south of Castro, including  the church in Vilupulli (UNESCO World Heritage Site) and the Museum of Traditions  in Chonchi.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 </strong><strong>— </strong><strong>At Sea, cruising  the Chilean Fjords </strong><br />\n  Let the onboard experts entertain you with tales of  early Spanish exploration, or perhaps you might want to attend a talk about the  region’s geology. </p>\n<p>Birders will want to see what species want to live  in this area. The further south we head the better the chance to see Andean  Condors majestically soaring above the hills and mountains. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — </strong><strong>English Narrows and  Pio XI Glacier </strong><br />\n  Early  this morning, be out on deck to watch as we head towards the English Narrows.  Our Captain and the local Chilean Pilots expertly manoeuvre <em>Silver Explorer</em> through the slalom  course of islands and channel markers. At the narrowest part it has a width of  80 metres, permitting the passage of only one vessel at a time. During this  cruise, we may spot Magellanic Diving Petrels and Steamer Ducks, and if we are  very lucky, we may spot the endemic Chilean dolphin. Shy of ships, this small  dolphin enjoys spending its time in narrow channels with heavy tidal rips.</p>\n<p>We  should pass the English Narrows before breakfast time –although you can see the  Narrows from the comfort of your suite, you really should be out on deck. </p>\n<p>Once  we have passed the English Narrows you will have time for a leisurely breakfast  and to attend lectures about the fjords’ natural history or perhaps a seminar. The whole region of the fjords is so inhospitable  that only one single settlement exists south of the English Narrows –Puerto  Eden.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, we will visit the Pio XI  Glacier. This tidewater glacier sprawled out in front of us is 4.5 km wide and  a remarkable shade of brilliant blue. An outlet glacier of the South Patagonian  Ice Field, the Pio XI had once extended out into the fjords whose waters we ply  today. Conditions permitting, we will board our Zodiacs and dodge brash ice and  bergy bits as we approach the glacier at a safe distance. Alert for signs of  calving, we may see chunks of ice falling from the glacier front. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 8 — Cruise the Chilean Fjords, White Narrows, Puerto Natales, Chile</strong><br />\n  Our course will take us through the vast expense of  the Chilean Fjords. We will sail through Chile’s largest national park,  Bernardo O’Higgins, before we head for another famous narrow channel, the White  Narrows, during the afternoon. </p>\n<p>Mountains loom on both sides of <em>Silver Explorer</em> and one can only marvel  at the hardy flora trying to cling to the barren rocks. Occasionally seals and  dolphins can be seen.</p>\n<p>In the evening we will reach Puerto Natales, the  point of access to Torres del Paine National Park. We will overnight to be able  to head out in the early hours of the following day to see Torres del Paine. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 </strong><strong>— </strong><strong>Puerto Natales, Chile&nbsp; </strong> <br />\n  Established as the capital of the Province of  Ultima Esperanza (“Last Hope”) Puerto Natales is our starting point for either  a full day excursion to Torres del Paine. </p>\n<p>Three granite peaks are the trademark of Torres del  Paine. To see them we will have to start quite early and will drive through the  pampa, where sheep, guanaco and foxes can be seen while we approach the Paine  Massif. This national park is famous for its extensive trekking possibilities  and we do a walk to see some of the rivers and valleys, as well as waterfalls  and, obviously, the three ‘horns’ of Paine. The rivers all come from the  Southern Patagonia Ice field.<br />\n  We will enjoy a typical lunch at a restaurant in  the national park while there.<br />\n  During the drive you will be taken through  extensive sheep grazing areas, with a possibility to see guanaco, foxes, ‘baqueanos’  (the local shepherds on horseback), and local birdlife. Condors can sometimes  be seen.</p>\n<p>We will overnight again in Puerto Natales to be  able to take the White Narrows when tide permits the next morning. Perhaps you  might want to try a local <em>parrillada</em>, <em>empanaditas</em> and one of the many  varieties of Pisco Sour served in Puerto Natales.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 </strong><strong>— </strong><strong>Puerto Natales and Strait of Magellan, Chile&nbsp; </strong> <br />\n  We will leave Puerto Natales during breakfast and  will once more go through the White Narrows, before we turn south, heading for  the Strait of Magellan.</p>\n<p>Our Marine Biologist might talk about Chile’s Marine  Park Francisco Coloane, created for its whales and dolphins, while our  Historian might want to talk about Magellan or the importance of this waterway  for shipping.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 11 — Punta  Arenas</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Although  Punta Arenas started as a small penal colony in  1848, Punta Arenas today is the capital of Chile’s southernmost region  -Magallanes and Antarctic Chile. The city grew in the 19th century because of a  gold rush and extensive sheep-farming. Before the building of the Panama Canal,  the Strait of Magellan was of prime importance to navigation and Punta Arenas  still is the entrance for Antarctica for South America’s west coast.</p>\n<p>Depart from the pier for an excursion to see one of  two working sheep ranches near Punta Arenas. Depending on your choice it will  be a half day excursion or a full day excursion –in this latter case the visit  includes a typical tasty barbeque luncheon of Patagonian lamb and baked  empanadas accompanied by Pisco Sours and wine.<br />\n  If you want to see how and where Chile’s first  settlement of the region started, travel south along the coastal road bordering  the Magellan Strait until reaching the Patagonia History Park. Here you will  visit Fuerte Bulnes, a reconstruction of the first settlement going back to  1843.</p>\n<p>If you want to explore the city of Punta Arenas on  your own, visit the Mayorino Borgatello Museum founded by the Salesian  missionaries, where you can view exhibits illustrating the habitat and history  of Patagonia’s aboriginal people and the region’s natural history. A must for  any visitor to Punta Arenas is a stop at the Plaza de Armas, not only to browse  for some local products and souvenirs, but to see the imposing statue of  Fernando de Magallanes and to touch the toe of the Fuegian native sitting at  the base of the monument. There are several stately houses at or near the Plaza  de Armas that relate to famous expeditions to Antarctica, and a local  entrepreneur has even rebuilt Magellan’s ship <em>Victoria</em> in the outskirts of town.</p>\n<p>During the evening we will once again take the  Strait of Magellan, this time to head for the Beagle Channel. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 12 — Cruising  the Beagle Channel and Garibaldi Glacier </strong><br />\n  While we approach  the Garibaldi Glacier we sail through one of Chile’s newest and largest  national parks: Parque Nacional Alberto de Agostini (more than 5,600 square miles).  It is not only a national park, but has been declared a UNESCO Biosphere  Reserve because of its different ecosystems and special landscape.</p>\n<p>Eventually,  the <em>Silver Explorer</em> will enter the  Garibaldi Fjord, a narrow passage strewn with floating ice in shades of blue  and green. Ribbons of waterfalls snake down the steep mountainsides. At the  head of this picturesque fjord, take in the quiet splendour of the retreating  Garibaldi Glacier. The Captain and Expedition Leader will make the most of  local conditions and available time to allow us to explore the area. </p>\n<p>Later we  will continue through the 150-mile-long (241-km-long) Beagle Channel, named  after <em>HMS Beagle</em>, heading for our  final destination: Ushuaia.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 13 — Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will  arrive in Ushuaia in the morning. Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are  possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and  Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and  exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather  and wildlife activity.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Expedition Highlights:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Follow in the footsteps of  the great Antarctic explorers: Amundsen, Byrd, Charcot, Cook, Fiennes, de Gerlache,  Hillary, Shackleton, Stromness and Weddell</li>\n  <li>See snow-covered mountains,  mighty glaciers and spectacular icebergs</li>\n  <li>Encounter Rockhopper,  Gentoo, Macaroni, King, Adelie, Magellanic and Chinstrap Penguins</li>\n  <li>Watch for seals, dolphins,  and whales</li>\n  <li>Identify seabirds including  albatrosses, shearwaters and petrels</li>\n  <li>Visit historic sites of the  early explorers and the remains of whaling operations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 1 — Ushuaia, Argentina </strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Explorer</em> and meet some of your fellow  explorers as you become acquainted with the luxurious amenities found on board.  A mandatory safety drill will take place before you set sail. During the  afternoon, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and important members  of the crew. At sail away enjoy the mountain-lined shoreline of the Beagle  Channel while you leave Ushuaia and bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego, the Land  at the End of the World. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  The Expedition Team’s expert lecturers will present  ornithological and historical insights into the Falkland Islands, our first  destination. You might hear about the early European explorers and the  different attempts at settling the Falkland Islands/Malvinas. Get introduced to  the specific birdlife we expect to see during our stay by our onboard Ornithologist.</p>\n<p>Tonight, you are invited to attend a special Welcome  Aboard cocktail party hosted by the Captain, who will introduce the senior  officers.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 —&nbsp;&nbsp; West Point Island and  Saunders Island, Falkland Islands</strong><br />\n  Today’s  adventure introduces you to the remarkable beauty of the remote Falkland  Islands. <br />\n  In the  morning, watch for Peale’s dolphins and the distinctive black and white  markings of the Commerson’s dolphin as <em>Silver  Explorer</em> approaches West Point Island. Upon arrival, photographic  opportunities are everywhere as you walk across rolling moorland and admire  colonies of Black-browed Albatrosses that nest side-by-side with Rockhopper  Penguins. Learn about the island’s unique vegetation. The hospitable island  owners are always happy to answer your questions and share their stories.</p>\n<p>During  lunch, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will  reposition to Saunders Island, the second largest of the offshore islands. Apart  from its historical importance –this is where the first British settlement was  located- Saunders’ wildlife is quite varied. Depending on the weather  conditions we will attempt a landing at the Neck, to see several penguin  species, as well as other seabirds and land birds. Gentoo Penguins and King  Penguins reside in the open dune and sand flat area, while Rockhopper Penguins  (with the odd pair of Macaroni Penguins in between them), Imperial Shags and  Black-browed Albatrosses frequent Mount Richards. Other key bird species are  the Black–throated Finch, Ruddy-headed Goose and Falkland Steamer Duck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Stanley, Falkland Islands </strong><br />\n  Stanley  is the capital of the remote Falkland Islands, and has a distinct British  ambience. </p>\n<p>A classic ‘City  Highlights’ tour which covers Stanley and surrounding environs will be offered  this morning. This excursion passes by older and newer portions of Stanley, stopping  at the local harbor for small boats, both in current operations as well as half  sunken hulks from 100 years ago -some of which are now being used as docks.  Additional stops will be the shipwreck of the <em>Lady Elizabeth</em>, the peat cutting area, an outdoor whale bone  display, war memorials and the museum.</p>\n<p>Stroll through the charming streets of this colourful  little town, lined with quaint cottages and a variety of traditional pubs, and  visit the 19th-century Anglican cathedral. Some lingering reminders of the 1982  Falklands Conflict between Britain and Argentina may still be seen though the  island has settled back to its quiet business of raising sheep.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 5–6 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Binoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to  watch for seabirds and marine mammals. Gather in The Theatre to perhaps hear  about Captain Cook’s first visit to South Georgia or to learn about the  region’s wildlife and remarkable nature. Our knowledgeable onboard experts will  present lectures and seminars in a variety of scientific fields. Other onboard  diversions may include photography workshops, Spa treatments, a workout in the  Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Days 7–9 — South Georgia </strong><br />\n  This breathtaking destination of towering snow-covered  mountains, mighty glaciers, and low-lying grasslands attracts an astounding  concentration of wildlife: Southern fur seals, southern elephant seals and a  variety of albatross species including Black-browed, Light-mantled Sooty,  Grey-headed and the spectacular Wandering Albatross, plus thousands of King and  Macaroni Penguins.</p>\n<p>South Georgia is also linked to the early Antarctic  explorers. Captain James Cook first stepped ashore in 1775, but perhaps more  famous is Ernest Shackleton’s arrival in 1916 following the sinking of his ship <em>Endurance</em>. Visit the graves of  Shackleton and Frank Wild, and the whaling museum at Grytviken. Here are some  of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Cooper’s Bay </strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Enjoy a Zodiac cruise to  see Macaroni and Chinstrap Penguins on the rocks and in the water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Gold Harbour</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A large King Penguin colony  can be found near Bertrab Glacier.</li>\n  <li>Seals can be seen sunning  on the beaches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Grytviken</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Grytviken is a historic  whaling station. You can still see the remains of the activity, including  rusted hulls of long abandoned whaling and sealing ships, and some of the  working areas. </li>\n  <li>In the museum guests can  learn about past whaling techniques and view various exhibits on exploration  and discovery.</li>\n  <li>At the burial site of  famous explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton pay homage to the great explorer and his  many accomplishments. The remains of his faithful companion Frank Wild have  been brought to this cemetery too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Salisbury Plain</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Salisbury Plain is a  favourite breeding ground for hundreds of thousands of King Penguins. It is  amazing to see how they completely cover the beaches and hills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Days 10–11 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Participate in onboard activities, listen to some of  the lectures given, relax in one of the lounges, or peruse an array of titles  and topics in the well-stocked Library. Take a stroll on deck and enjoy the  solitude and splendour of the vast sea and sky. During the cruise towards the  Antarctic Peninsula we might see some of the giant tabular icebergs coming from  the Weddell Sea. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands </strong><br />\n  Awesome glaciers  greet us as we approach Elephant Island – so named for its former abundance of  elephant seals. In 1916, when Ernest Shackleton’s ship <em>Endurance</em> was crushed in pack ice in the Weddell Sea, the crew was  stranded here for 137 days. Elephant Island is home to several Chinstrap  Penguin rookeries, as well as old moss colonies. Weddell seals and Macaroni  Penguins can also be found on the spit of land Shackleton’s men named Point  Wild. A solitary statue can be seen there, honouring the Chilean pilot Luis  Pardo, who took the cutter <em>Yelcho</em> across the Drake Passage to rescue Shackleton’s men.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 13–16 — Antarctic Peninsula </strong><br />\n  While sailing along the Antarctic Peninsula, every  turn can reveal a new and breathtaking adventure. As the pack ice becomes  thicker, it is apparent to everyone that we are moving closer into Antarctica’s  vast white wilderness. Remote and otherworldly, Antarctica is irresistible for  its spectacular iceberg sculptures and calving glaciers, and for the  possibility of up-close encounters with marine mammals. </p>\n<p>A flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of  favourable sea and weather conditions. In the true spirit of expedition  cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best  course depending on weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter. Here  are some of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Brown Bluff, Tabarin Peninsula</strong> (a 2,200-foot bluff on mainland Antarctica)</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Brown Bluff is  an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of  reddish-brown volcanic rock. </li>\n  <li>Coming ashore  you will be on the Antarctic mainland</li>\n  <li>Adelie and  Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels use this as a breeding area. </li>\n  <li>As you explore  the area, a Weddell seal may be seen basking in the sunlight.</li>\n  <li>Wait long  enough and you might see the Adelie Penguins standing along the shore, finally  making their way into the surf. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cuverville Island, Errera Channel</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The island was  discovered by de Gerlache’s Belgian Antarctic expedition of 1897–99, and was  named for a vice-admiral in the French navy. </li>\n  <li>Large, bare  rock areas provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins. </li>\n  <li>Snow Petrels  and Cape Petrels may be seen, and Wilson’s Storm Petrels nest in the higher  scree of the island.</li>\n  <li>During Zodiac  tours, we hope to see hauled-out Weddell and leopard seals</li>\n  <li>Conditions  permitting, we will attempt to hike to the top of the island for some  spectacular panoramic views</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Paradise Bay</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The bay is well  named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs.</li>\n  <li>From the ship,  observe Argentina’s “Base Brown”, one of many Antarctic research stations.</li>\n  <li>View the  wildlife from sea level while cruising in your Zodiac with one of our  experienced Expedition Team members. There is a good chance you will come  across a crabeater seal relaxing on a nearby ice floe. Blue-eyed Shags nest in  the cliffs close to Base Brown, while Brown Skuas like to be around the base’s  buildings. Minke whales frequent the area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Port Lockroy, Goudier Island</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The British  built a listening station here during WWII, which was then used as a research  station in the 1950s and since 1996 as a museum and gift shop.</li>\n  <li>Snowy  Sheathbills and Gentoo Penguins roam outside the museum.</li>\n  <li>Perhaps sight a  whale or two during the Zodiac transfer.</li>\n  <li>Because of the  penguin colony leopard seals are quite often found in the vicinity. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Paulet Island</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The island is  home to 80-90 thousand Adelies that come here to breed.</li>\n  <li>On a nearby  hill, view a massive colony of Blue-eyed Shags.</li>\n  <li>Kelp Gulls and  Snowy Sheathbills are amongst the birds that breed on Paulet Island, and  Wilson’s Storm Petrels are regularly seen. </li>\n  <li>Listen as a  member of your Expedition Team tells of Otto Nordenskjold and his party that  over-wintered on the island in 1903. Remnants of their hut still remain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Port Foster, Whalers Bay</strong> <strong>(Deception  Island)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Deception  Island is home to a collapsed volcano and an excellent example of a caldera  where it is believed that the volcano’s summit collapsed with one section  sinking far enough to allow the sea to flood the interior. We plan to sail  inside this breached wall through a narrow entrance called Neptune’s  Bellows.&nbsp; </li>\n  <li>Our resident Geologist  will take the opportunity to explain the unique volcanic features of the area,  while our Historian might introduce you to the whaling history of Deception  Island. </li>\n  <li>Still visible  on the island are the boilers used to make whale oil in the early 1900s.</li>\n  <li>The British  base’s Biscoe House was destroyed by a mudflow after a volcanic eruption in the  late 1960s and both the mudflow and the volcanic ash having covered extensive  areas can still clearly be seen.</li>\n  <li>Depending on  weather conditions several hikes to viewpoints might be offered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Days 17–18 — Drake Passage </strong><br />\n  The Drake Passage has a  notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to strong westerly winds and  the currents pushed through the ‘narrow’ gap between South American and the  Antarctic Peninsula. The Antarctic Convergence is a natural boundary where cold  polar waters flow northward and warmer equatorial water moves southward. When  these currents meet, nutrients are pushed to the surface, often attracting a  multitude of seabirds and whales. Spend some time on deck watching the horizon  and the variety of seabirds that glide in the air currents of our ship’s wake  such as the Black-browed Albatross, Sooty Shearwaters, and White-chinned  Petrels. Take this opportunity to attend additional presentations offered by  the Expedition Team lecturers and to swap photos with new friends as we travel  towards Ushuaia.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 19 — Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences  only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work  together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best  possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice  conditions.

A mandatory safety drill will take place before you set sail. During the  afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and important members  of the crew. At sail away enjoy the mountain-lined shoreline of the Beagle  Channel while you leave Ushuaia and bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego, the Land  at the End of the World. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  The Expedition Team’s expert lecturers will present  ornithological and historical insights into the Falkland Islands, our first  destination. You might hear about the early European explorers and the  different attempts at settling the Falkland Islands/Malvinas. Get introduced to  the specific birdlife we expect to see during our stay by our onboard Ornithologist.</p>\n<p>Tonight, you are invited to attend a special Welcome  Aboard cocktail party hosted by the Captain, who will introduce the senior  officers.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 —&nbsp;&nbsp; West Point Island and  Saunders Island, Falkland Islands</strong><br />\n  Today’s  adventure introduces you to the remarkable beauty of the remote Falkland  Islands. <br />\n  In the  morning, watch for Peale’s dolphins and the distinctive black and white  markings of the Commerson’s dolphin as <em>Silver  Explorer</em> approaches West Point Island. Upon arrival, photographic  opportunities are everywhere as you walk across rolling moorland and admire  colonies of Black-browed Albatrosses that nest side-by-side with Rockhopper  Penguins. Learn about the island’s unique vegetation. The hospitable island  owners are always happy to answer your questions and share their stories.</p>\n<p>During  lunch, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will  reposition to Saunders Island, the second largest of the offshore islands. Apart  from its historical importance –this is where the first British settlement was  located- Saunders’ wildlife is quite varied. Depending on the weather  conditions we will attempt a landing at the Neck, to see several penguin  species, as well as other seabirds and land birds. Gentoo Penguins and King  Penguins reside in the open dune and sand flat area, while Rockhopper Penguins  (with the odd pair of Macaroni Penguins in between them), Imperial Shags and  Black-browed Albatrosses frequent Mount Richards. Other key bird species are  the Black–throated Finch, Ruddy-headed Goose and Falkland Steamer Duck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Stanley, Falkland Islands </strong><br />\n  Stanley  is the capital of the remote Falkland Islands, and has a distinct British  ambience. </p>\n<p>A classic ‘City  Highlights’ tour which covers Stanley and surrounding environs will be offered  this morning. This excursion passes by older and newer portions of Stanley, stopping  at the local harbor for small boats, both in current operations as well as half  sunken hulks from 100 years ago -some of which are now being used as docks.  Additional stops will be the shipwreck of the <em>Lady Elizabeth</em>, the peat cutting area, an outdoor whale bone  display, war memorials and the museum.</p>\n<p>Stroll through the charming streets of this colourful  little town, lined with quaint cottages and a variety of traditional pubs, and  visit the 19th-century Anglican cathedral. Some lingering reminders of the 1982  Falklands Conflict between Britain and Argentina may still be seen -though the  island has settled back to its quiet business of raising sheep.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 5–6 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Binoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to  watch for seabirds and marine mammals. Gather in The Theatre to perhaps hear  about Captain Cook’s first visit to South Georgia or to learn about the  region’s wildlife and remarkable nature. Our knowledgeable onboard experts will  present lectures and seminars in a variety of scientific fields. Other onboard  diversions may include photography workshops, Spa treatments, a workout in the  Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Days 7–9 — South Georgia </strong><br />\n  This breathtaking destination of towering snow-covered  mountains, mighty glaciers, and low-lying grasslands attracts an astounding  concentration of wildlife: Southern fur seals, southern elephant seals and a  variety of albatross species including Black-browed, Light-mantled Sooty,  Grey-headed and the spectacular Wandering Albatross, plus thousands of King and  hundreds of Macaroni Penguins.</p>\n<p>South Georgia is also linked to the early Antarctic  explorers. Captain James Cook first stepped ashore in 1775, but perhaps more famous  is Ernest Shackleton’s arrival in 1916 following the sinking of his ship <em>Endurance</em>. Visit the graves of  Shackleton and Frank Wild, and the whaling museum at Grytviken. Here are some  of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Cooper’s Bay </strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Enjoy a Zodiac cruise to  see Macaroni and Chinstrap Penguins on the rocks and in the water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Gold Harbour</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A large King Penguin colony  can be found near Bertrab Glacier.</li>\n  <li>Seals can be seen sunning  on the beaches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Grytviken</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Grytviken is a historic  whaling station. You can still see the remains of the activity, including  rusted hulls of long abandoned whaling and sealing ships, and some of the  working areas. </li>\n  <li>In the museum guests can  learn about past whaling techniques and view various exhibits on exploration  and discovery.</li>\n  <li>At the burial site of  famous explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton we commemorate the great explorer and his  many accomplishments. The remains of his faithful companion Frank Wild have  been brought to this cemetery too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Salisbury Plain</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Salisbury Plain is a  favourite breeding ground for hundreds of thousands of King Penguins. It is  amazing to see how they completely cover the beaches and hills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Days 10–11 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Participate in onboard activities, listen to some of  the lectures given, relax in one of the lounges, or peruse an array of titles  and topics in the well-stocked Library. Take a stroll on deck and enjoy the  solitude and splendour of the vast sea and sky. During the cruise towards the  Antarctic Peninsula we might see some of the giant tabular icebergs coming from  the Weddell Sea. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands </strong><br />\n  Awesome glaciers  greet us as we approach Elephant Island – so named for its former abundance of  elephant seals. In 1916, when Ernest Shackleton’s ship <em>Endurance</em> was crushed in pack ice in the Weddell Sea, the crew was  stranded here for 137 days. Elephant Island is home to several Chinstrap  Penguin rookeries, as well as old moss colonies. Weddell seals and Macaroni  Penguins can also be found on the spit of land Shackleton’s men named Point  Wild. A solitary statue can be seen there, honouring the Chilean pilot Luis  Pardo, who took the cutter <em>Yelcho</em> across the Drake Passage to rescue Shackleton’s men.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 13–16 — Antarctic Peninsula </strong><br />\n  While sailing along the Antarctic Peninsula, every turn  can reveal a new and breathtaking adventure. As the pack ice becomes thicker,  it is apparent to everyone that we are moving closer into Antarctica’s vast  white wilderness. Remote and otherworldly, Antarctica is irresistible for its  spectacular iceberg sculptures and calving glaciers, and for the possibility of  up-close encounters with marine mammals. </p>\n<p>A flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of  favourable sea and weather conditions. In the true spirit of expedition  cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best  course depending on weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter. Here  are some of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Brown Bluff, Tabarin Peninsula</strong> (a 2,200-foot bluff on mainland Antarctica)</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Brown Bluff is  an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of  reddish-brown volcanic rock. </li>\n  <li>Coming ashore  you will be on the Antarctic mainland</li>\n  <li>Adelie and  Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels use this as a breeding area. </li>\n  <li>As you explore  the area, Weddell seals may be seen basking in the sunlight.</li>\n  <li>Wait long  enough and you might see the Adelie Penguins standing along the shore, finally  making their way into the surf. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cuverville Island, Errera Channel</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The island was  discovered by de Gerlache’s Belgian Antarctic expedition of 1897–99, and was  named for a vice-admiral in the French navy. </li>\n  <li>Large, bare  rock areas provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins. </li>\n  <li>Snow Petrels  and Cape Petrels may be seen, and Wilson’s Storm Petrels nest in the higher  scree of the island.</li>\n  <li>During Zodiac  tours, we hope to see hauled-out Weddell and leopard seals</li>\n  <li>Conditions  permitting, we will attempt to hike to the top of the island for some  spectacular panoramic views</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Paradise Bay</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The bay is well  named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs.</li>\n  <li>From the ship,  observe Argentina’s “Base Brown”, one of many Antarctic research stations.</li>\n  <li>View the  wildlife from sea level while cruising in your Zodiac with one of our  experienced Expedition Team members. There is a good chance you will come  across a crabeater seal relaxing on a nearby ice floe. Blue-eyed Shags nest in  the cliffs close to Base Brown, while Brown Skuas like to be around the  buildings. Minke whales frequent the area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Port Lockroy, Goudier Island</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The British  built a listening station here during WWII, which was then used as a research  station in the 1950s and since 1996 as a museum and gift shop.</li>\n  <li>Snowy  Sheathbills and Gentoo Penguins roam outside the museum.</li>\n  <li>Perhaps sight a  whale or two during the Zodiac transfer.</li>\n  <li>Because of the  penguin colony leopard seals are quite often found in the vicinity. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Paulet Island</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>As you arrive,  the sight of Adelie Penguins covering the entire island may well amaze you. The  island is home to thousands of Adelies that come here to breed.</li>\n  <li>On a nearby  hill, view a massive colony of Blue-eyed Shags.</li>\n  <li>Kelp Gulls and  Snowy Sheathbills are amongst the birds that breed on Paulet Island, and  Wilson’s Storm Petrels are regularly seen. </li>\n  <li>Listen as a  member of your Expedition Team tells of Otto Nordenskjold and his party that  over-wintered on the island in 1903. Remnants of their hut still remain. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Port Foster, Whalers Bay</strong> <strong>(Deception  Island)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Deception  Island is home to a collapsed volcano and an excellent example of a caldera  where it is believed that the volcano’s summit collapsed with one section  sinking far enough to allow the sea to flood the interior. We plan to sail  inside this breached wall through a narrow entrance called Neptune’s  Bellows.&nbsp; </li>\n  <li>Our resident Geologist  will take the opportunity to explain the unique volcanic features of the area,  while other experts might introduce you to the whaling history of Deception  Island. Still visible on the island are the boilers used to make whale oil in  the early 1900s.</li>\n  <li>The British  base’s Biscoe House was destroyed by a mudflow after a volcanic eruption in the  late 1960s and both the mudflow and the volcanic ash having covered extensive  areas can still clearly be seen.</li>\n  <li>Depending on  weather conditions several hikes to viewpoints might be offered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Days 17–18 — Drake Passage </strong><br />\n  The Drake Passage has a  notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to strong westerly winds and  the currents pushed through the ‘narrow’ gap between South American and the  Antarctic Peninsula. The Antarctic Convergence is a natural boundary where cold  polar waters flow northward and warmer equatorial water moves southward. When  these currents meet, nutrients are pushed to the surface, often attracting a  multitude of seabirds and whales. Spend some time on deck watching the horizon  and the variety of seabirds that glide in the air currents of our ship’s wake  such as the Black-browed Albatross, Sooty Shearwaters, and White-chinned  Petrels. Take this opportunity to attend additional presentations offered by  the Expedition Team lecturers and to swap photos with new friends as we travel  towards Ushuaia.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 19 — Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences  only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work  together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best  possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice  conditions.

A dramatic peak and the world’s largest Black-browed Albatross colony make for an interesting visit. Once used for sheep grazing, the island is now used to monitor wildlife. Other birds breeding on the island include Falkland Skuas, Striated Caracara and Southern Giant Petrels. Rockhopper, Magellanic and Gentoo Penguins frequent the island too. Strong tidal currents and extensive kelp beds can make landings on the quartz sandstone difficult, but the setting of the plain with tussac grass, the different birds species and the steep peaks in the background make for a very photogenic setting. </p>\n\n<p>During lunch, while <em>Silver Explorer</em> will reposition to West Point Island, watch for Peale’s dolphins and the distinctive black and white markings of the Commerson’s dolphin as <em>Silver Explorer</em> approaches the island and anchorage.

We might come across a crabeater seal relaxing on a nearby ice floe, while Blue-eyed Shags nest in the cliffs close to Almirante Brown, where Brown Skuas like to be. Minke whales do frequent the area.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Port Lockroy, Goudier Island</strong><br />\n-The British built a listening station here during WWII, which was then used as a research station in the 1950s and since 1996 as a museum and gift shop.<br />\n-Snowy Sheathbills and Gentoo Penguins roam and nest outside the museum.<br />\n-Because of the penguin colony leopard seals are quite often found in the vicinity. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Paulet Island</strong><br />\n-The island is home to 80-90 thousand Adelies and a massive colony of Blue-eyed Shags.<br />\n-Kelp Gulls and Snowy Sheathbills are amongst the birds that breed on Paulet Island, and Wilson’s Storm Petrels are regularly seen. <br />\n-Part of Otto Nordenskjold’s team had to over-winter on the island in 1903. Remnants of their hut still remain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Port Foster, Whalers Bay (Deception Island)</strong><br />\n-Deception Island is an example of a caldera where it is believed that the volcano’s summit collapsed with one section sinking far enough to allow the sea to flood the interior. We plan to sail into Port Foster through Neptune’s Bellows, a narrow entrance in Deception Island’s breached wall. <br />\n-Dating back to the whaling history of Deception Island are the boilers used to make whale oil in the early 1900s.<br />\n-The British base’s Biscoe House was destroyed by a mudflow after a volcanic eruption in the late 1960s but can still clearly be seen.<br />\n-Depending on weather conditions several hikes to viewpoints might be offered.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Days 17–18 — Drake Passage<br /></strong><br />\nThe Drake Passage has a notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to strong westerly winds and the currents pushed through the ‘narrow’ gap between South American and the Antarctic Peninsula. The Antarctic Convergence is a natural boundary where nutrients are pushed to the surface, often attracting a multitude of seabirds and whales. Spend some time on deck watching the horizon and the variety of seabirds that glide in the air currents of our ship’s wake such as the Black-browed Albatross, Sooty Shearwaters, and White-chinned Petrels. Take this opportunity to attend additional presentations offered by the Expedition Team lecturers and to swap photos with new friends as we travel towards Ushuaia.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Day 19 — Ushuaia, Argentina<br /></strong><br />\nAfter breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\nEmbark <em>Silver Explorer</em> and meet some of your fellow explorers as you become acquainted with the luxurious amenities found on board. A mandatory safety drill will take place before you set sail. During the afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and important members of the crew. At sail-away enjoy the mountain-lined shoreline of the Beagle Channel while you leave Ushuaia and bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego, the Land at the End of the World.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — At Sea</strong><br />\nThe Expedition Team’s expert lecturers will present ornithological and historical insights into the Falkland Islands, our first destination. You might hear about the early European explorers and the different attempts at settling the Falkland Islands/Malvinas. Get introduced to the specific birdlife we expect to see during our stay by our onboard Ornithologist.</p>\n<p>Tonight, you are invited to attend a special Welcome Aboard cocktail party hosted by the Captain, who will introduce his senior officers.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 —&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steeple Jason Island and West Point Island, Falkland Islands</strong><br />\nToday’s adventure introduces you to the remarkable beauty of the remote islands of the Falkland Islands/Malvinas.</p>\n<p>Steeple Jason is the westernmost of the two larger islands making up the Jason Island group in the northwestern part of the Falklands. A dramatic peak and the world’s largest Black-browed Albatross colony make for an interesting visit. Once used for sheep grazing, the island is now used to monitor wildlife. Other birds breeding on the island include Falkland Skuas, Striated Caracara and Southern Giant Petrels. Rockhopper, Magellanic and Gentoo Penguins frequent the island too. Strong tidal currents and extensive kelp beds can make landings on the quartz sandstone difficult, but the setting of the plain with tussac grass, the different birds species and the steep peaks in the background make for a very photogenic setting. </p>\n<p>During lunch, while <em>Silver Explorer</em> will reposition to West Point Island, watch for Peale’s dolphins and the distinctive black and white markings of the Commerson’s dolphin as <em>Silver Explorer</em> approaches the island and anchorage. Upon arrival, photographic opportunities are everywhere as you walk across rolling moorland and admire colonies of Black-browed Albatrosses that nest side-by-side with feisty Rockhopper Penguins. Learn about the island’s unique vegetation. The hospitable island owners are always happy to answer your questions and share their stories.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Stanley, Falkland Islands</strong><br />\nStanley is the capital of the remote Falkland Islands, and has a distinct British ambience. </p>\n<p>Take the classic ‘City Highlights’ tour which covers Stanley and surrounding environs. This excursion passes by older and newer portions of Stanley, stopping at the local harbor for small boats, both in current operations as well as half sunken hulks from 100 years ago -some of which are now being used as docks. Additional stops will be the shipwreck of the Lady Elizabeth, the peat cutting area, an outdoor whale bone display, war memorials and the museum.</p>\n<p>You should also stroll through the charming streets of this colourful little town, lined with quaint cottages and a variety of traditional pubs, and visit the 19th-century Anglican cathedral. Some lingering reminders of the 1982 Falklands War between Britain and Argentina may still be seen though the island has settled back to its quiet business of raising sheep.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 5–6 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Binoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to watch for seabirds and marine mammals. Gather in The Theatre to perhaps hear about Captain Cook’s first visit to South Georgia or to learn about the region’s endemic wildlife and unique nature. Our knowledgeable onboard experts will present lectures and seminars in a variety of scientific fields. Other onboard diversions may include photography workshops, spa treatments, a workout in the Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Days 7–10 — South Georgia</strong><br />\nThis breathtaking destination of towering snow-covered mountains, mighty glaciers, and low-lying grasslands attracts an astounding concentration of wildlife: Southern fur seals, southern elephant seals and a variety of albatross species including Black-browed, Light-mantled Sooty, Grey-headed and the spectacular Wandering Albatross, plus thousands of King and Macaroni Penguins.</p>\n<p>South Georgia is also linked to the early Antarctic explorers. Captain James Cook first stepped ashore in 1775, but perhaps more famous is Ernest Shackleton’s arrival in 1916 following the sinking of his ship Endurance. Visit the graves of Shackleton and Frank Wild, and the whaling museum at Grytviken. Here are some of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Cooper’s Bay </strong><br />\n-Enjoy a Zodiac cruise to see Macaroni and Chinstrap Penguins on the rocks and in the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Gold Harbour</strong><br />\n  -A large King Penguin colony can be found near Bertrab Glacier.<br />\n-Seals can be seen sunning on the beaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Grytviken</strong><br />\n  -Grytviken is a historic whaling station. You can still see the remains of the activity, including rusted hulls of long abandoned whaling and sealing ships, and some of the working-areas. <br />\n  -In the museum guests can learn about past whaling techniques and view various exhibits on exploration and discovery.<br />\n-At the burial site of famous explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton we will toast the great explorer. The remains of his faithful companion Frank Wild have been brought here too.</p>\n<p><strong>Salisbury Plain</strong><br />\n-Salisbury Plain is a favourite breeding ground for hundreds of thousands of King Penguins. It is amazing to see how they completely cover the beaches and hills.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — At Sea</strong><br />\nParticipate in onboard activities, listen to some of the lectures given, relax in one of the lounges, or peruse an array of titles and topics in the well-stocked Library. Take a stroll on deck and enjoy the solitude and splendour of the vast sea and sky. During the cruise towards the South Sandwich Islands we might see some of the giant tabular icebergs coming from the Weddell Sea. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 12-13 — South Sandwich Islands</strong><br />\n  For two days we want to explore the rarely visited southeastern outpost of the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. These islands were first seen in 1775 during Captain Cook’s second major voyage, searching for Terra Australis Incognita. Although known for almost three hundred years, the different islands have rarely been visited and only for a very short period did humans actually live on them in a military base.<br />\nWe intend to sail along the arc of 11 islands and marvel at the incredible wildlife that has chosen such an inhospitable place as their own. The islands are believed to host to over 3,000,000 Chinstrap Penguins, plus more than 100,000 Macaroni Penguins, 100,000 Adélies, and thousands of Gentoo Pengins. Despite the icy location, some of the islands have active volcanoes. Travelling from North to South we intend to have a look at:</p>\n<p>-Zavodovski Island –this volcanically very active island is almost free of snow and ice. It is believed that more than 2 million Chinstrap Penguins make Zavodovski their home.<br />\n  -Candlemas and Vindication –these two islands are close neighbours. Candlemas has a glacier-covered basaltic stratovolcano at its southern end, while the northern part has scoria cones with radiating lava flows. Vindication Island is home to a large Chinstrap Penguin colony at the aptly named Chinstrap Point.<br />\n  -Montagu –this is the largest of the South Sandwich Islands and home to Mount Belinda, the highest point in the South Sandwich Islands. The summit rises about 3,000 metres from the seaflorr, reaching a height of 1,370 metres. Despite its last eruption in 2007, the massive shield volcano is mostly ice-covered. <br />\n  -Thule Island and Cook Island –these are the southernmost of the South Sandwich Islands. Captain Cook had been this far south and gave it the name Thule, as this seemed the end of the world.&nbsp; There are a few ice-free sectors on the islands and Adelie and Chinstrap colonies exist. An Argentine meteorological/military base had been set up in the 1970s, but was destroyed after the Falkland war. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 14- 15 — At Sea</strong><br />\nHaving been to places few others even know exist, participate in discussions and lectures about the early British and Russian explorers that visited the area, and learn more about the hardy wildlife that manages to survive in these waters. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 16 — South Orkney Islands</strong><br />\nToday <em>Silver Explorer</em> will be in front of the South Orkneys. Depending on the weather and sea conditions we might visit the Argentine base “Orcadas del Sur”, which can claim to be the longest occupied human settlement in Antarctica, and hear about the work done at this station. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 17 — Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands</strong><br />\nSteep mountains and glaciers greet us as we approach Elephant Island – so named for its former abundance of elephant seals. In 1916, when Ernest Shackleton’s ship Endurance was crushed in pack ice in the Weddell Sea, the crew was stranded here for 137 days. Elephant Island is home to several Chinstrap Penguin rookeries, as well as old moss colonies. Weddell seals and Macaroni Penguins can also be found on the spit of land Shackleton’s men named Point Wild. A solitary statue can be seen there, honouring the Chilean pilot Luis Pardo, who took the cutter Yelcho across the Drake Passage to rescue Shackleton’s men.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 18– 21 — Antarctic Peninsula</strong><br />\nWhile sailing along the Antarctic Peninsula, every turn can reveal a new and breath-taking adventure. As the pack ice becomes thicker, it’s apparent to everyone that we are moving closer into Antarctica’s vast white wilderness. Remote and otherworldly, Antarctica is irresistible for its spectacular iceberg sculptures and calving glaciers, and for the possibility of up-close encounters with marine mammals. Watch for seals sunbathing on slow-moving ice floes and for humpback, Minke, and orca whales to surface from below the frigid waters. </p>\n<p>A flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of favourable sea and weather conditions. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter. Here are some of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Brown Bluff, Tabarin Peninsula (mainland Antarctica)</strong><br />\n  -Brown Bluff is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock. <br />\n  -Coming ashore you will be on the Antarctic mainland<br />\n  -Adelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels use this as a breeding area. <br />\n  -As you explore the area, a Weddell seal may be seen basking in the sunlight.<br />\n-If conditions permit, we might hike onto a nearby glacier. </p>\n<p><strong>Cuverville Island, Errera Channel</strong><br />\n  -The island was discovered by de Gerlache’s Belgian Antarctic expedition of 1897–99, and was named for a vice-admiral in the French navy. <br />\n  -Large, bare rock areas provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins. <br />\n  -Snow Petrels and Cape Petrels may be seen, and Wilson’s Storm Petrels nest in the higher scree of the island.<br />\n-During Zodiac tours, we hope to see hauled-out Weddell and leopard seals</p>\n<p><strong>Paradise Bay (Antarctic Peninsula)</strong><br />\n  -The bay is well named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs.<br />\n  -From the ship, observe Argentina’s “Base Almirante Brown”, one of many Antarctic research stations.<br />\n-View the wildlife from sea level while cruising in your Zodiac.

There’s a good chance you will come across a crabeater seal relaxing on an ice floe or locate Minke whales.</p>\n<p><strong>Paulet Island</strong> <br />\n  -The island is home to 80-90 thousand Adelie Penguins that come here to breed.<br />\n  -On a nearby hill, view a massive colony of Blue-eyed Shags.<br />\n  -Kelp Gulls, Snowy Sheathbills and Wilson’s Storm Petrels are amongst the other birds that visit or breed on Paulet Island. <br />\n  -The crew of Otto Nordenskjöld’s Swedish Antarctic Expedition relief ship <em>Antarctic</em> had to over-winter on the island in 1903. Remnants of their hut still remain.</p>\n<p><strong>Petermann Island, Wilhelm Archipelago</strong><br />\n  -The island is named for German geographer August Petermann and was first discovered by a German expedition in 1873-74. <br />\n  -Various geological features such as the many leucocratic dikes along the shoreline and the more granitic composition towards the small ice-covered summit are clearly visible. Rock surfaces show glacial polish, some glacial grooving and nice samples of frost shattering. <br />\n  -During our landing, we will be able to observe rookeries of Adelie Penguins, Gentoo Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags. </p>\n<p><strong>Pleneau Island, Wilhelm Archipelago</strong><br />\n  -Pleneau Island lies at the south end of the Lemaire Channel, and was first explored during Charcot’s 1903–05 French Antarctic Expedition. The island was named for the expedition’s photographer, Paul Pleneau.<br />\n  -Amongst the common breeding birds are Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls and South Polar Skuas.<br />\n  -Southern elephant seals are often hauled-out in wallows. <br />\n  -Enjoy spectacular glacial and ice scenery.</p>\n<p><strong>Port Foster, Whalers Bay</strong> (Deception Island)<br />\n  -Deception Island is an excellent example of a caldera where it is believed that the volcano’s summit collapsed with one section sinking far enough to allow the sea to flood the interior. We plan to sail inside this breached wall through a narrow entrance called Neptune’s Bellows.&nbsp; <br />\n  -Our resident Geologist will take the opportunity to explain the unique volcanic features of the area while our naturalists might introduce you to the whaling history of Deception Island. Still visible on the island are the boilers used to make whale oil in the early 1900s.</p>\n<p><strong>Port Lockroy, Goudier Island</strong> <br />\n  -The British built a listening station here during WWII, which was then used as a research station in the 1950s and since 1996 as a museum and gift shop.<br />\n  -Snowy Sheathbills and Gentoo Penguins roam and nest outside the museum.<br />\n  -Perhaps sight a whale or a leopard seal on your Zodiac approach to Goudier Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 9–10 — Drake Passage Return </strong><br />\n  Navigating our return through the Drake Passage, we will watch for seabirds and wildlife we may have missed on the first leg. Take this opportunity to attend additional presentations offered by the Expedition Team lecturers and to swap photos with new friends as we travel towards Ushuaia.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\n  Embark the <em>Silver Explorer</em> and depart on your exciting Silversea Expedition — “Chilean Fjords”. <br />\n  Once you have settled in and before <em>Silver Explorer</em> leaves Ushuaia, you will attend a mandatory safety drill. Later you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and this evening you can enjoy the delights of a specially prepared menu in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — Cruise the Garibaldi Fjord and Glacier </strong><br />\n  Heading west in the Beagle Channel, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will reach the Garibaldi Fjord early in the morning. This beautiful corner of the Chilean fjords lies within the Alberto de Agostini National Park, Chile’s third largest national park. This park - with its 14.600 km2 - includes all Chilean islands south of the Strait of Magellan, including a portion of Tierra del Fuego.<br />\nThe Garibaldi is an impressive glacier on the south face of the Cordillera Darwin. During a Zodiac cruise we will see the different shades of blue of the ice -and calving events can make for a very impressive sight. Dozens of waterfalls dot the cliffs and in some cases the wind gusts can be so strong that the water gets blown upwards!</p>\n<p>In terms of wildlife we can expect the majestic Andean Condor, a South American sea lion colony, skuas, kingfishers, Flightless Steamer Ducks, Crested Ducks, Kelp Geese, Ashy-headed Geese, caracaras, vultures, and nesting Imperial Shags among others.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  During the afternoon, <em>Silver Explorer </em>will sail out into the Pacific Ocean to reach the entrance to the Strait of Magellan and our experts will present talks in The Theatre to give you an introduction to Chile and the region’s wildlife and nature. Today our lecturers will introduce you to the natural and historical highlights of Chile’s Magallanes Region and its capital Punta Arenas. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 —Alberto de Agostini National Park and Ainsworth Bay, Chile</strong><br />\nToday <em>Silver Explorer</em> will navigate past Dawson Island –quite infamous in Chile’s modern-day history as a penal settlement for political prisoners- into Almirantazgo Sound, to arrive at Ainsworth Bay. The bay is within Alberto De Agostini National Park, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Depending on conditions, we intend to offer a Zodiac cruise to see the Marinelli Glacier descending from Darwin Mountain Range. This area will give a good appreciation how the land returns to life after glacial retreat. We also intend to take a walk in the stunning sub-polar Magellanic forest teeming with evergreens and deciduous trees. The bay promises a good chance of sighting Southern elephant seals, while nearby Tucker Island is known to have Magellanic Penguins.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 —Punta Arenas, Chile</strong><br />\nLeaving from Punta Arenas, the capital of the region, you have two options: you can either drive to the estancia El Galpón or visit historic Fort Bulnes.</p>\n<p>At El Galpón you will get an understanding of the procedure of the wool and the importance of cattle and sheep to Patagonia through presentations of a video and the demonstration of sheep shearing. There is also a guided path of local flora, while rheas and guanacos can be seen roaming free. Visit the small museum and enjoy a cocktail before heading back to the pier.</p>\n<p>Another option would be to head south along the Strait of Magellan towards the Patagonia History Park and Fort Bulnes, a reconstruction of the first Chilean settlement along the Strait of Magellan. The wooden buildings give a Wild West feeling –more appropriately Wild South- and the recently inaugurated visitor’s centre will give an insight into the fort founded in 1843 and the impact it had on the region. Enjoy a stroll around the fort and the views of the Strait. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Montañas Fjord, Chile</strong><br />\n<em>Silver Explorer</em> will cruise the Chilean Fjords and head for&nbsp; the Montañas Fjord in the late morning, early afternoon. <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail parallel to the Cordillera de Sarmiento where several cascades and seven glaciers come down the steep sides of the mountains and –conditions permitting- we might do a Zodiac cruise or even land for a short hike. In the afternoon we will continue towards Puerto Natales. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Puerto Natales, Chile</strong><br />\nFrom Puerto Natales we will head out to Torres del Paine National Park by bus. This is considered by many to be the most spectacular worldwide Reserve at the end of the world. Covering an area of 242,000 hectares, the park is a fertile combination of lakes, lagoons, waterfalls, glaciers, hills and spectacular peaks and is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. On the way to Laguna Sarmiento, the entrance to the park, we will stop for photos of the free roaming guanacos, Andean Condors and other wildlife. There will be opportunities to see the Salto Grande waterfall, the famous Torres del Paine peaks (weather permitting) and Nordenskjold Lake. Lunch will be had at the Serrano River area. Within the park there will be three different options of walks and hikes –depending on your fitness or willingness to exercise.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Puerto Natales and White Narrows, Chile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nLeaving Puerto Natales, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will reach the White Narrows and another spectacular facet of the vast expenses of Chile’s largest national park, Bernardo O’Higgins. The famous White Narrows become evident as mountains loom in on both sides of the fjord with hardy native plants clinging to barren rock. With only approximately 80 meters (260 feet) of clearance from either side of the passage, the sharp turns of the ship, skillfully executed between rocky outcrops, are fascinating to watch from the outer decks. On the transit through the breathtaking White Narrows, it is also possible to see seals and dolphins plying the waters alongside the ship.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Cruising the Chilean Fjords</strong><br />\n  Our course will take us through the vast expense of the Chilean Fjords. We will sail through Chile’s largest national park, Bernardo O’Higgins, heading north for another famous narrow channel, the English Narrows. Mountains loom on both sides of the ship and while <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail past Wellington Island –at 5,556 km² Chile’s second-largest island- our experts will continue to assist you on deck looking for birds and mammals, while discussions and lecture will also take place in The Theatre.<br />\n  &nbsp;<br />\n  <strong>Day 8 — Cruise Pio XI Glacier and English Narrows, Chile</strong><br />\nDuring the morning attend lectures about the Fjords’ natural history or perhaps a seminar. Birders will want to know and see what species live in this area. We might still have a chance to see Andean Condors majestically soaring above the hills and mountains. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Around lunchtime we will visit the Pio XI Glacier. This tidewater glacier sprawled out in front of us is 4.5 km wide and a remarkable shade of brilliant blue. An outlet glacier of the South Patagonian Ice Field, the Pio XI had once extended out into the fjords whose waters we ply today. </p>\n<p>In the evening –actually during dinnertime- we head towards the English Narrows. Our Captain and the local Chilean Pilots expertly manoeuvre <em>Silver Explorer</em> through the slalom course of islands and channel markers. At the narrowest part it has a width of 80 metres, permitting the passage of only one vessel at a time. <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  Once we have passed the English Narrows you will have time for a leisurely dinner</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Tortel, Chile</strong><br />\nOur course will take Silver Explorer to Caleta Tortel, one of the southernmost and until 2003 least connected settlements in Chile’s Aisén Region (in Patagonia). The abundant cypress led to the founding of the village and most houses are built on stilts along the shoreline of this hilly terrain. There are no conventional streets; instead the houses are connected by wooden walkways. We will explore the village –where a folkloric presentation awaits us at the main plaza- and will take our Zodiacs cruise through the channels and the Baker River to visit “La Isla de los Muertos”, a small island used as a cemetery in 1906. Both the village and the island have been declared National Monuments.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — At sea, Chile</strong><br />\n  Today <em>Silver Explorer</em> will venture again into the Pacific and will round the Tres Montes and Taitao Peninsulas – the sea tends to be rough, but the area is known for its whales and dolphins sightings.<br />\nWatch for cetaceans or relax in one of the lounges with that book you’ve been meaning to read and meet up with new friends for cocktails. </p>\n<p>During the night, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will pass the Guaitecas Archipelago and will enter calm waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Castro, Chile</strong><br />\n  Chiloé Island is home to an amazing collection of 150 Jesuit-built wooden churches, houses raised up on poles out of the water, and more than 400 native plant varieties. <br />\n  From Castro, we head north to the picturesque village of Dalcahue and a brief ferry ride to the island of Quinchao, passing through Curaco de Velez. This tiny village of approximately 500 inhabitants had its best times around 1850. Today, beautiful houses remain as a testament to those earlier days. Black-necked Swans can sometimes be seen near the here. We then head for Achao, which was founded by the Jesuits in 1743. Achao is a lively town with boats arriving every day from all the surrounding islands.<br />\n  We will visit the Jesuit’s Achao Church, the oldest wooden structure in Chiloé and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Constructed in 1730, it contains beautiful baroque imagery. Afterwards, we take the ferry back to Dalcahue. Here we will visit the well-preserved Dalcahue Church with its galvanized iron roof. The details and precision of the imagery carved by Jesuits from locally grown Patagonian cypress, larch and luma trees, are amazing -it was declared a World Heritage site in 2000. For lunch we head to Rilan, where a traditional “Pulmay” will be served. This is a meal typical of Chiloe, consisting of shellfish, potatoes, chicken and smoked meats cooked together in a pot (sometimes in an underground oven).There will be a traditional folkloric presentation and a local fashion show of typical dresses and materials.<br />\nAlternatively, visit three of the 16 UNESCO World Heritage Site churches on the island of Chiloé in Vilupulli, Chonchi and Castro. Apart from the churches, the Museum of Traditions will be visited in Chonchi. This small museum houses artefacts and photos relating to Chiloe and Chonchi and recreates the feeling of Chonchi in the early 20th century. The excursion ends with a visit to Castro’s handicraft market.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 —Puerto Montt, Chile</strong><br />\nPuerto Montt is the starting point for our excursions to the Lake District and specifically Lago Llanquihue.</p>\n<p>We will drive along the southern shore of Chile’s second-largest lake and head for the Petrohué waterfalls. These falls ‘connect’ Lago Esmeralda with Lago Llanquihue and we will walk over to the viewing platforms of Chile’s best-known falls. Here we will have an opportunity to see some of the local plants and endemic trees. Later you will have the choice to either visit a typical Chilean farm to learn about the traditions of southern Chile’s food, music, tools and the national sport of rodeo –which is quite different from the North American version- or to have lunch at a local restaurant and to explore the town of Puerto Varas.<br />\n  If you choose the Fundo Olguita, you will have lunch including empanadas, a tasty barbeque und traditional German desserts –this area was first colonized by Germans in the mid-19th century. You will also have the chance to learn the Chilean national dance, the Cueca.</p>\n<p>If you choose Puerto Varas, you will have time to explore the “City of Roses” –as Puerto Varas is known- and to browse the small handicraft village and see some of the wooden buildings for which the town was declared a “Heritage Zone”.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 — Niebla, Chile</strong><br />\nDuring the late morning <em>Silver Explorer</em> will anchor in the Corral Bay halfway between Corral and Niebla. Niebla is a small village on the banks of the Rio Valdivia where Chile’s Corral Bay meets the Pacific Ocean. Today Niebla is a beach resort, but in 1671 it was a defensive fortress built by Spanish conquerors to prevent attacks from pirates and corsairs. </p>\n<p>Today you can either drive to the charming river port city of Valdivia, where we will find an interesting blend of influences from the native Mapuche, Spanish settlers, and German immigrants, or take a catamaran on the river. In both cases you will have time to see the town of Valdivia. The first German colonists arrived here in 1849 and worked hard to develop Valdivia into one of southern Chile’s most productive areas and their influence can be felt in every corner of this city. The town was affected by the 1960 earthquake –the worst ever recorded- but rebuilt with a strong German imprint. On our way to Valdivia we can see tracts of land that are still under water as a result of the quake. We will visit the river market and have a look at downtown Valdivia with its mix of old and modern buildings. You will have to choose whether you would like to visit the Fort at Niebla or enjoy fresh fish and crabs in Valdivia.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 —At sea</strong><br />\nDuring the last day of our voyage, edit your photos and videos, attend final presentations and discussions and watch our Voyage-DVD prepared by the onboard Videographer.</p>\n<p>Following the Humboldt Current, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will continue north along the Chilean coast, heading for the most populous area of Central Chile -with the most important harbours, the seat of Parliament (Valparaiso) and the capital (Santiago). <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 15 —Valparaiso, Chile</strong><br />\n  While Silver Explorer approaches Valparaiso, take in the sights of “The Pearl of the Pacific” –as the city is known in Chile’s literature and music. Valparaiso’s historic hillside settlements (including the still used funiculars) have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<br />\n  After breakfast disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Valparaiso, Chile</strong><br />\n  Embark the <em>Silver Explorer</em> and depart on your exciting Silversea Expedition — “Lands of the Humboldt Current”. Before <em>Silver Explorer</em> leaves the harbour a mandatory safety drill will be conducted. During a special sail away party look back at the spectacular setting of Valparaiso –the “Pearl of the Pacific”- and its historic centre, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. <br />\nLater you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and this evening you can enjoy the delights of shrimp in a specially prepared menu in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — Coquimbo, Chile</strong><br />\n  Today you have two choices: a morning visit to the colonial-style city of La Serena or a longer visit to the Limarí Valley.<br />\n  For the morning excursion we first drive south to La Herradura Bay and its 1.2 mile long beach before heading north and the beach resort of La Serena, Chile’s second-oldest city. The coastal avenue leads to a famous landmark of the region, a lighthouse built in the mid-20th century. Driving along the Francisco de Aguirre Boulevard –named after the second founder of the city- and its many reproductions of ancient statues, we will reach the Main Plaza and the Recova Market. Set in a picturesque patio, this market has the famous blue semi-precious lapis lazuli, pottery and ceramics with Diaguita design, as well as alpaca wool articles on offer. <br />\n  The other excursion will take us into the Limarí Valley, slightly further south. Known for its pictographs and petroglyphs of the El Molle culture, we will visit the Enchanted Valley in the vicinity of the town of Ovalle. The Elqui and Limarí Valleys are rich and fertile transversal valleys running across the coastal mountains, leading to their importance as agricultural areas. Grapes are grown in impressive vineyards for export and for wine and we will visit the Tabalí winery. Starting in the early 1990s, already in its first year of production Tabalí obtained 24 medals. This vineyard is well known for its unique coupages and blends of wine stocks such as Viognier, Sangiovese and Carmenere. A guided tour of the winery will be given, followed by a tasting of its most representative wines.<br />\nWe will then continue to a local restaurant for a typical Chilean lunch of empanadas and an asado (a BBQ), before returning to the pier. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 — Isla Pan de Azucar, Chile</strong><br />\n  During the morning attend a lecture or a seminar and let our chefs talk about and prepare some delicious Chilean seafood. <br />\nThis afternoon we explore the rugged shores of Isla Pan de Azucar (or Sugarloaf Island) by Zodiac. The island is home to thousands of Humboldt Penguins. During our Zodiac cruise along the perimeter of Isla Pan de Azucar, we also hope to encounter Kelp Gulls, Turkey Vultures, Blackish Oystercatchers, and Peruvian Boobies, pelicans, sea lions and the reclusive South American marine otter.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 4-5 — Antofagasta, Chile</strong><br />\n  On our first day in Antofagasta we will explore the city during the morning. Antofagasta is a refined blend of traditional Chilean town and British colonial city. We will see the Huanchaca Ruins and during a walking tour will visit the Plaza Colón and the Regional Museum with its overview of the saltpetre industry and how it affected the region. The final destination will be La Portada, an enormous rock caressed by the sea and sand until a giant arch formed, before heading back to <em>Silver Explorer</em> for lunch.<br />\nIn the afternoon we intend to offer walks and hikes in the National Reserve La Chimba, to see how plants and animals have adopted to life in the coastal desert and mountains.</p>\n<p>During our second day we will venture inland to see remains of Chile’s mining and saltpetre activities of the early 20th century. Driving east we will reach the ghost town or oficina of “Chacabuco”. Although the town existed for a period of less than 15 years, it had been designed for 5,000 miners and had its own theatre. The town became quite famous and was declared a Historic Monument in 1971, only to be used as a concentration camp two years later. Some of the buildings like the former theatre have been restored with the help of the German Embassy and a saltpetre museum has been added. Another stop will be made at the former railroad junction of Baquedano, where the old railroad station has been declared a Historic Monument and several of the old locomotives, wagons, the building to overhaul the engines and a small museum can be seen.</p>\n<p>Optional overland excursion to visit the Atacama Desert — one of the driest places on earth. <br />\n  Depart early for the five-hour ride to the charming adobe village of San Pedro de Atacama. Once we reach San Pedro we will have a look at the small church –a Historic Monument- and continue to the hotel grounds where we will have lunch. During the afternoon we will visit the archaeological site of Tulor. This former village complex has dates going back to the fourth century BC and circular walls and vaults are a typical architectural feature. Afterwards we will be heading to Valle de la Luna. In this unique lunar landscape we will see numerous rock formations jutting out of the sand, eroded by wind into incredible shapes. At a lookout, we will enjoy a special cheese and wine tasting.<br />\n  Back at our hotel we will have dinner with live Andean music.<br />\n  On our second day in the Atacama Desert we will visit the 740 km² “Reserva Nacional Los Flamencos” in the extensive Atacama Salt Flat -with 3,000 km² the third-largest salt flat in the world. During our drive to Chaxa lagoon we might see Puna Plovers, Yellow-billed Teals, Andean Avocets and Chilean and Andean Flamingos. The Andean Flamingos that migrate between Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina use this area as one of their most important breeding grounds. Returning to the hotel, we will have lunch before we start our drive back to Antofagasta. A photo stop will be made at the Tropic of Capricorn crossing. The excursion will end in time to have dinner aboard <em>Silver Explorer</em>. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Gather in The Theatre to hear fascinating tales of adventure or to learn about the region’s wildlife and remarkable nature. <br />\n  Due to the presence of the very nutrient-rich Humboldt Current, the waters along the Chilean coast are incredibly rich in fish life. Today our chefs might introduce you to the world of “ceviche” in all its forms.<br />\n</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Arica, Chile</strong><br />\n  An early morning departure is necessary for our journey to explore the region’s unique Altiplano scenery. We will see important archaeological sites along the way before the landscape suddenly opens up and the wide valley of Putre can be seen beneath massive, snow-capped peaks. Upon our arrival in Putre, we will enjoy lunch in a local restaurant. Later we will stroll through town together, visiting the church and watching a performance of Andean folklore in the main plaza. <br />\nAlternatively, enjoy a visit to the Lauca National Park. This is a challenging excursion, taking you to an altitude of 4,500 metres. From the pier we will drive to the Copaquilla Pukara, a pre-Incan defensive settlement. Continuing on, we will be driving past Putre to reach Chungará Lake and to admire the mountains reflected in the lake. During one hour at the lake we will look for the many local bird species, among them the Chilean Flamingo. During the stay at the lake a box lunch will be served. On the return we will stop at the abandoned pre-Hispanic village of Parinacota, a National Monument.</p>\n<p>The half day excursions will permit you to either visit the Archaeological Museum and to see the main highlights of the downtown area and having a view from the iconic promontory El Morro or to visit the local market, choosing fresh produce with the help of a local chef, visit a farm and learn about the famous Azapa olives and taste the special appetizers prepared by the local chef with the products you selected at the market.<br />\n  Other half day tours will feature local foods selected by you at the market and prepared by local chefs while visiting some emblematic natural highlights in the vicinity of Arica.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Matarani, Peru</strong><br />\nThis morning we will drive to Arequipa, “The White City”. Join our experts for a walking tour of the UNESCO Historical Centre including the Plaza de Armas and the Cathedral, followed by a guided visit of Santuarios Andinos, home to the Sarita and Juanita mummies. Found close to the summit of a nearby mountain, they were likely a sacrifice to an Incan god. </p>\n<p>We will then head over to the Dominican Santa Catalina Monastery -one of the most important and impressive religious monuments in Peru. The complex is huge and fascinating; it is almost a city within the city. We will undertake a guided tour of this impressive monastery. </p>\n<p>Later the refectory of the monastery will be especially reserved for our group while we enjoy a three-course lunch accompanied by live music featuring Andean folk songs.</p>\n<p>This evening our chefs will feature regional fare, and especially potatoes and other tubers. Peru has more than 1000 varieties of potatoes…</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — At Sea</strong><br />\nA leisurely day at sea is yours to enjoy. Participate in discussions and onboard activities led by the Expedition Team. Then relax in one of the lounges with that book you’ve been meaning to read and meet up with new friends for cocktails. Before turning in for the night, take a stroll on deck to take in the solitude of the vast sea and sky.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Paracas, and Ballestas Islands, Peru</strong><br />\n  Nazca Lines Overflight<br />\nDuring a special Silversea Expedition complimentary excursion to see the famous Nazca Lines from the air, the Nazca Desert will reveal a series of famous geoglyphs stretching for miles along the Pacific coast.</p>\n<p>Dating back to an era between 200BC and 700AD, these mysterious figures and geometric patterns are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The lines show an understanding of sophisticated mathematics and surveying techniques.<br />\n  After this special experience of over-flying the Nazca Lines, we will head to the beautiful Hotel Paracas, where we will enjoy a very comprehensive and interesting Pisco Tasting. In a shaded area and overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a Pisco expert will present 5 different types of Pisco. Apart from learning about Pisco you will obviously get to taste Peru’s (and Chile’s) national drink and counterbalance the drinks with some local appetizers. <br />\n  If you do not want to see the Nazca Lines, then explore the Ballestas Islands -one of this region’s most beautiful natural attractions. Sea lions, cormorants, Blue-footed Boobies, terns, pelicans and Humboldt Penguins can all be expected around the Ballestas Islands. Because of Peruvian regulations this excursion can only be done in local boats and landings are not allowed. <br />\n</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Callao, Peru</strong><br />\n<em>Silver Explorer</em> will arrive in Callao in the morning. Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice conditions. Expedition Team members scheduled for this voyage are subject to change or cancellation.</p>\n<p><strong>GEAR UP</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not sure what to wear while onboard? <a style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #000; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://www.shiptoshoretraveler.com/silversea\">Visit our shop and gear up</a>.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Callao, Peru</strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Explorer</em> and depart on your exciting 14-day Silversea Expedition — Ancient Worlds and Natural Wonders. This evening, after settling in and participating in a mandatory safety drill, we will be setting sail and your Expedition Leader will introduce important members of the crew and the Expedition Team. Tonight we invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — Isla Guañape, Peru</strong><br />\n  Have a leisurely breakfast and attend one of the lectures about Peru and the Humboldt Current before we arrive at our destination for the afternoon. <br />\n  Located off the coast of La Libertad, Peru, two islands, North and South Guañape, along with several small islets constitute a biological reserve for seabirds. In 2009, the National Wildlife Refuge System of Peru officially protected the islands. The rugged, rocky, and dry island group is uninhabited by people, but is home not only to large colonies of South American sea lions, but to hundreds of thousands of seabirds. These include Peruvian Pelicans, Inca Terns, Blue-footed Boobies and Humboldt Penguins. In our Zodiacs we will cruise along the island and adjacent islets to get a better view of the birds and the buildings and walls set up to collect guano.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 3 — Salaverry, Peru</strong><br />\n  This morning we will visit Trujillo, to see its colonial Main Plaza and historical houses, before heading to the main religious centre of the Mochica culture east of the town. The archaeological complex includes the Temple of the Sun –one of the largest adobe structures in the world- and the Temple of the Moon, covered with beautiful Moche designs.<br />\nWe will next visit a private hacienda for sparkling wine and appetizers, witnessing a performance of Peruvian Paso horses -an unrivalled opportunity to immerse ourselves in genuine Peruvian culture spanning centuries. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Cruise &amp; Explore Isla Lobos de Tierra, Peru</strong><br />\n  Today, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will be off Isla Lobos de Tierra and Lobos de Afuera — steep and rocky islands that protrude more than 200 feet from the surface of the deep blue Pacific. An abundant array of marine mammals and seabirds surround these two islands and offer us a splendid opportunity to explore with our Zodiacs. Sea lions bask on the beach and hundreds of Blue-footed Boobies can be viewed ashore as well, while Peruvian Pelicans pass overhead. If the weather permits, we will attempt to make a landing on the island.<br />\n  In the afternoon attend a lecture about Ecuador and its natural history preparing you for Machala and Isla de la Plata. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Machala, Ecuador</strong><br />\n  Machala, with a population of approximately 250,000 inhabitants, is called the “Capital of the Banana” as the ‘World Fair of the Banana’ is held there during the third week of September. Fortunately for us, there is more to Machala than just bananas: opposite Machala is Santa Clara. Whales and dolphins can sometimes be seen in Santa Clara’s vicinity, although most sightings occur later in the year. </p>\n<p>Several National Sanctuaries or Ecological Reserves can be found near Machala and you have three options: you can either visit the Buenaventura cloud forest reserve with its staggering amount of hummingbirds and a known lek of the rare Long-wattled Umbrellabird, or visit the Arenillas Reserve, a “dry forest”. If you like extremes, the Puyango Petrified Forest might be more to your liking: it is one of the largest petrified forests in the world –located within a lush tropical forest.</p>\n<p>Since Machala is also known for several typical dishes, mostly seafood -from raw marinated shrimp to shrimp soup and fried shrimp; and from fried bananas to fish soup, all excursions will have some sample of local refreshments. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Isla de la Plata, Ecuador</strong><br />\n  Exploration and discovery await us as we anchor off the coast of the uninhabited and unspoilt Isla de la Plata. The island’s name was derived from the legend of Sir Francis Drake’s buried silver treasure. The island was privately owned until 1979, when it was declared part of Ecuador's Machalilla National Park. Best known for its fauna, which is amazingly similar to that of the Galapagos Islands, Isla de la Plata is a delightful place for birding, photography and long nature walks.</p>\n<p>As we approach the island, Blue-footed Boobies circle overhead. Together with our local natural history guides, we will go ashore and enjoy various walks, watching for herons, pelicans, gulls, and Magnificent Frigatebirds, Blue-footed, Red-footed, and Nazca Boobies. Potential songbirds on the island include Collared Warbling-Finch, Short-tailed Woodstar, and Gray-and-white Tyrannulet. A special treat would be the Waved Albatross, an endemic to Isla de la Plata and Española, Galapagos. </p>\n<p>Although just south of the equator, the influences of the colder Humboldt Current bring nutrient-rich water as far north as Isla de la Plata. If conditions permit, we might also offer some snorkelling.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Attend informative lectures that will prepare you for the upcoming ports-of-call in Colombia.<br />\n  Apart from lectures there might also be a workshop or seminar, you can relax on the Sun Deck, have a cigar in the Connoisseurs Corner or partake in Team Trivia, testing your knowledge about the area we are passing through.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Utria National Park, Colombia</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em>’s first stop in Colombia will be at Nuqui Harbour. Our explorations of the Colombian Pacific coast starts with a visit to Utria National Natural Park. From coral reefs and mangroves to the marine environment, tropical rainforest and rocky beaches where sea turtles come to lay their eggs, few places in the world encompass the diversity of Utría’s ecosystems. The Expedition Team will offer a choice of trail hikes to explore the park’s numerous highlights. During our walk, we hope to see some of Utría’s great variety of animal life, which includes deer, wild pigs, anteaters, black howler and spider monkeys, wild cats (such as jaguar, puma and ocelot), sloths, and some rodent species.<br />\n  As for flora, the park has several species of timber trees, notably the area’s beloved Cohiba tree and the Oquendo tree, which is used in the creation of local art and handicrafts. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Bahia Solano, Colombia</strong><br />\n  We arrive quite early in Bahia Solano, where we will anchor offshore and be brought to land by local tender or Zodiac. Bahía Solano is located in splendid isolation; connected to the outside world by a single, small local airport. Tucked inside a beautiful bay, the small Columbian town is lined by the Pacific Ocean on one side and thick, impenetrable jungle on the other. The majority of the 10,000 residents work in local industries, which are predominantly fishing, agriculture and eco-tourism.</p>\n<p>If you select the Bahia Solano Town Tour with your own local guide, the tour begins at the local secondary school, where you will be welcomed by the children who will guide you through their school. Afterwards, take a relaxed walk through the community, wandering the streets with their array of different shops and businesses, visiting the main church, the primary school and library, before visiting the small fishing port where there will be a small display of the locally caught fish, which are flown out daily to the main cities of Colombia. The tour ends on the “malecón” or seafront with the opportunity to see an artisans’ market where handicrafts will be available for sale. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Today <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail from South America to Central America, crossing slightly south of the Gulf of Panama. As we intend to visit iconic national parks and ecosystems, attend lectures that will tell you more about the many aspects of Costa Rica’s nature. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Puerto Quepos, Costa Rica</strong><br />\n  We go ashore by Zodiac to the small port town of Quepos. Quepos is less than 4.5 miles (7 km) from Costa Rica’s most popular gem, Manuel Antonio National Park -one of the most stunning and bio-diverse areas of the world. Spread out over 683 hectares it is filled with diverse wildlife, has both primary and secondary forests, boasts a stunning shoreline ideal for bird-watching or swimming, and is home to a number of endemic species of plants and animals including iguanas, sloths, and squirrel monkeys. Together with our Costa Rican naturalist guides we will hike through the exotic, bio-diverse tropical rainforests.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, enjoy a cruise through the mangroves, an important ecosystem packed with hundreds of species of marine and land animals, aboard a sturdy vessel designed for this type of cruising. Your guides and captain navigate around shifting sandbanks to reveal the animals, insects and plants that lie hidden from the untrained eye. We will pass through wide lagoons where many species of seabirds can be observed, and round narrow passages, hoping for a chance to encounter white-collared capuchin monkeys.</p>\n<p>If cruising on a river is more to your liking, choose the Savegre River, considered one of Central America’s most beautiful rivers, for a two-hour class I &amp; II amazing river floating activity. During the bus ride to El Silencio, from where the river part starts, and the river floating you will have spectacular scenery and can see cormorants, egrets, herons, and White Ibises.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica </strong><br />\nToday we have the opportunity to visit Santuario Silvestre de Osa – the only wildlife sanctuary and rescue centre in Golfo Dulce that devotes all of its efforts to the care and rehabilitation of rainforest animals. The sanctuary is home to a wide variety of orphaned and injured animals including: howler monkeys, spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys, white-faced capuchin monkeys, scarlet macaws, toucans, parrots and two-toed sloths. We will enjoy the sanctuary grounds in the company of the park’s creators and wardens as they share their wealth of knowledge on local natural history and show us some of these animals. We will also visit Casa Orquideas, a beautiful garden that contains many tropical plants and a medicinal garden.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to watch for dolphins and other marine life, choose to go on a catamaran. The country’s best spot to watch large groups of dolphins, sea turtles and manta rays is in the waters off the Osa Peninsula. Marlins and sailfish can sometimes be seen chasing large schools of tuna, while six different species of turtles might glide by. If time permits there will be the opportunity to swim in the placid waters of Punta Encato.</p>\n<p>For those wanting a little more activity, a nature walk in the National Wildlife Refuge of Golfito is on offer. Golfito is surrounded by a spectacular primary rainforest with more than 125 species of trees, 31 species of orchids, and 300 species of birds. Bird species that can be spotted during the hikes include toucans and tanagers, while all four Costa Rican monkey species also call Golfito National Wildlife Refuge home.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 13 — Isla Coiba, Panama</strong><br />\n  This morning we take our manoeuvrable Zodiacs and hope to land at this remote part of Panama for a hike through the rainforest. The island is part of the Coiba National Park –a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Our onboard naturalists will point out the local flora and search for signs of wildlife. The jungles of Coiba are home to mantled howler monkeys, Coiba Island agoutis, and white-tailed deer, Crested Eagles, Brown-backed Doves and Scarlet Macaws. There are 97 bird species, 20 of them endemic, including the Coiba Spinetail. </p>\n<p>Just offshore from this nature preserve, a rocky headland provides an ideal spot for snorkelling. Join the onboard Marine Biologist and learn to identify damsel fish, jacks, and surgeon fish, trumpet fish, parrot fish, trigger fish and whitetip reef sharks. Hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead and olive ridley sea turtles frequent Coiba’s waters too. Take this opportunity to relax on the beach and enjoy true Silversea hospitality as your butlers serve fresh fruit skewers and a variety of cocktails.</p>\n<p>During the afternoon attend a lecture about Panama and the Darien Jungle’s special nature. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 — Darien Jungle, Panama</strong><br />\nThis morning <em>Silver Explorer</em> will anchor in the Darien Jungle’s Bay of San Miguel. We will explore this pristine, remote and seldom visited area by Zodiac or local canoe, navigating up the tidal Mogue River. The Darien Jungle has one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world and is recognised as one of the world’s top ten birding sites –apart from being a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We hope to see the colourful Crimson-collared Tanager, Green and Chestnut-fronted Macaws, Rufous-tailed and Snow-bellied Hummingbirds, as well as tapir and black-headed spider monkeys, vultures, and the endangered Great Curassow.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of our river adventure, we will be welcomed at the remote Embera Village. The Darien Jungle is rarely visited by outsiders (fewer than 1,000 tourists visit each year), and the Embera are one of several indigenous groups that live in relative isolation.</p>\n<p>We will go ashore to melodic rhythms of traditional tribal music and the local women and children in brightly coloured will lead us to their village and introduce us to their way of life. We will visit authentic tribal dwellings and the Embera will perform native dances and demonstrate basket weaving and carving techniques. There will be the opportunity to purchase souvenirs, including beautiful handcrafted baskets and carvings.</p>\n<p>Special Request: When preparing for your “Ancient Worlds and Natural Wonders” Expedition, we encourage you to purchase and pack a donation of school supplies. Much-needed items include pens, pencils, writing pads, reading material, and new or second-hand clothes for children ages 1 to 12 years old. The village is also always in need of prescription reading glasses, over-the-counter medicine and medical equipment. Donations will be collected on board by the Expedition Team and distributed to the local villagers during our visit as part of our cultural exchange.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 15 — Panama City, Panama</strong><br />\nAfter breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice conditions.

Take this opportunity to relax on the beach and enjoy true\nSilversea hospitality as your butlers serve fresh fruit skewers and a variety\nof cocktails. </p><p>\n\n\n<b>Day 4 — Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica </b></p><p>\n\nToday we have the opportunity to visit Santuario Silvestre de Osa – the only wildlife\nsanctuary and rescue centre in Golfo Dulce that devotes all of its efforts to\nthe care and rehabilitation of rainforest animals. The sanctuary is home to a\nwide variety of orphaned and injured animals, including howler monkeys, spider\nmonkeys, squirrel monkeys, white-faced capuchin monkeys, scarlet macaws,\ntoucans, parrots and two-toed sloths. \nThe other option is to visit the famous gardens of Casa Orquideas (Orchid House). There\nare more than 100 varieties of orchids and while strolling through the gardens,\ntanager, toucans and parrots can usually be seen.</p><p>\n\n\n<b>Day 5 — Corcovado National Park, Costa Rica</b>\n\n</p><p> To be able to see the different faces of the Corcovado National Park and its surrounding\nforest reserves, wildlife refuges and wetlands can offer, we go ashore by\nZodiac in Bahia Drake. \nAt Bahia Drake there will be several options to explore the national park: you can go\nhorseback riding along the beach to enter the jungle, looking for Scarlet\nMacaws, finally reaching a lookout point to see Isla Cano, a biological\nreserve, in the distance. For an\nadrenaline-charged experience you will be driven to the northwestern border of\nCorcovado National Park and the village of Los Planes. Here a rainforest canopy\nzip-line tour across 11 different cables will give you a different view of the\npark. If you prefer to be active yourself, then take the third choice: a walk\nalong the Corcovado biological corridor, exploring forest, seashore, fresh\nwater ponds and gardens. The walk will lead over a hanging bridge to a viewing\nplatform. </p><p>\n\n\n<b>Day 6 — Curu National Wildlife Refuge, CostaRica\n\nCuru National</b> </p><p>Wildlife Refuge is located on the southern Nicoya Peninsula of\nnorthwestern Costa Rica. We go ashore by Zodiac to explore this area teaming\nwith abundant wildlife and one of the most unspoiled beaches on the Nicoya\nPeninsula. Curu National Wildlife Refuge is managed sustainably to produce\nprofit and employment through low level cattle grazing and the harvest of\ntropical fruits, while at the same time protecting otherwise threatened\nforested habitats such as mangroves, tropical moist and dry forests, and coral\nreefs. Some 200 species of birds thrive in the area and during a walk we will\nlook for Scarlet Macaws, Rufous-tailed hummingbirds and Blue-gray Tanagers, as\nwell as capuchin and howler monkeys.</p><p>\n\n<b>Day 7 — Puerto Quepos, Costa Rica</b>\n\n</p><p>We go ashore by Zodiac to the port of Quepos. The small town of Quepos is close to\nCosta Rica’s most popular gem, Manuel Antonio National Park, which is where we want\nto begin the day’s exploration. Manuel Antonio National Park is one of the most\nstunning and bio-diverse areas of the world. Spread out over 683 hectares it is\nfilled with diverse wildlife, has both primary and secondary forests, boasts a\nstunning shoreline ideal for bird watching or swimming, and is home to a number\nof endemic species of plants and animals including iguanas, sloths, squirrel\nmonkeys, colourful crabs, and the ceiba tree, which, according to ancient Mayan\nculture, is the tree of life that links us to the spirit world. Together with\nour Costa Rican naturalist guides we will stroll through the exotic,\nbio-diverse tropical rainforests hoping to encounter monkeys and sloths as they\ntraverse the tree canopy, and listen to the songs of the multitude of birds.\nAlternatively,enjoy a cruise through the mangroves, considered to be an important ecosystem\npacked with hundreds of species of marine and land animals. Aboard a sturdy\nvessel designed for this type of cruising, you will be taken around shifting sandbanks\nto reveal the animals, insects and plants that lie hidden from the untrained\neye. We will pass through wide lagoons where many species of seabirds can be\nobserved, and round narrow passages, hoping for a chance to encounter\nwhite-collared capuchin monkeys. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 8 — San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua</b> </p><p>\n\nSan Juan del Sur is a small coastal town of roughly 8,000 inhabitants that has become\nsomewhat of a tourist attraction with its many fishing boats in the bay and\nsurf spots nearby. San Juan del Sur is the starting point for excursions to\nGranada, Nicaragua’s oldest colonial city, to see the cathedral and convent of\nSan Francisco, and to Lake Nicaragua. Less than 12 miles separate the Pacific\nOcean from Lake Nicaragua and this is where a channel would have been built\ninstead of the Panama Canal, had it not been for the very active volcanoes\nfound in and near the lake. During a cruise on the lake some of the more than\n360 small islands that dot the lake can be seen. These mostly uninhabited\nislands are home to exotic plants and animals.</p><p>\n\n<b>Day 9 — Corinto, Nicaragua</b> </p><p>\n\nJust south of El Salvador’s Gulf of Fonseca and west of Lake Xolotlán is the port of\nCorinto. Some 20 miles to the east is Leon, Nicaragua’s second-largest city. Today\nwe have the opportunity to visit this former capital of Nicaragua. Next to\nManagua Leon is the intellectual centre of the country. Apart from having\nCentral America’s second-oldest university, the amount of colonial buildings,\nincluding its 18th century cathedral, the many churches and residential houses,\nrivals those of Granada. The tomb of Ruben Dario, one of Central America’s most\nimportant poets, is also found in Leon. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 10 — La Union, El Salvador</b> </p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\"></span>\n\nEntering the Gulf of Fonseca and its sidearm the Bahia de La Union, <i>Silver Explorer</i> will go alongside in La Union, El Salvador’s second-most\nimportant harbour. Today we have the opportunity to visit the volcano\nConchagua. From the top of the volcano excellent panoramic views of El Salvador\nand the neighbouring countries of Honduras and Nicaragua can be had.\n</p><p>\n\n<b>Day 11 — Bahia de Jiquilisco, El Salvador</b> </p><p>\n\nJiquilisco Bay is a hidden treasure of the Pacific. Today we have the opportunity to\nexplore the many side arms and beautiful channels of the bay to appreciate an\nexotic variety of mangroves either by Zodiac (pending permission) or by kayak.\nAnother option will be to visit Central America’s largest cacao plantation in\nSan Jose Real de la Carrera. There you can not only see the plantation, but\nalso the plant for processing, drying and fermenting cacao, and can taste the\nfruit and have a cup of hot chocolate. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 12 — Acajutla, El Salvador</b> \n\n</p><p>Acajutla is El Salvador’s main harbour and the perfect jumping point for excursions to Mayan\nsites, spectacular nature and colonial towns and villages. El Salvador’s\nimportant Mesoamerican sites visited today on a full day tour include Joya de Cerén,\na pre-Hispanic farming community that was buried under an eruption of the\nLaguna Caldera volcano declared a UNESCO World heritage Site , and the\nimportant political and religious centres of San Andrés and Tazumal. North of\nAcajutla is the El Imposible National Park. This area with the highest\ndiversity of wildlife is the largest ecoregion in El Salvador and has been put\non the UNESCO World heritage tentative list. Coffee used to be transported\nthrough a perilous gorge, resulting in the name “the impossible”. Coffee is\nstill grown in the area and we can visit one of the plantations. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 13 — Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala</b>\n\n</p><p> Disembark the <i>Silver Explorer</i> after breakfast\nand head for Guatemala City and the return home.</p>",

        "voyage_highlights": "<strong>Day 1 — Mazatlán, Mexico<br />\n  </strong>Embark <em>Silver Explorer</em> and depart on your exciting 11-day Silversea Expedition — <strong>Expedition Baja and Sea of Cortez</strong>. This evening, after settling in and participating in a mandatory safety drill, we will be setting sail and your Expedition Leader will introduce important members of the crew and the Expedition Team. Tonight we invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.<br />\n  <strong></strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 2 — Los Islotes and Espiritu Santo, Mexico<br />\n</strong>Have a leisurely breakfast and attend a lecture about the Sea of Cortez before we arrive at our destination in the late morning. \n<p>Located off the east coast of Baja California, two islands, Espiritu Santo and Isla Partida, constitute an important biological reserve. Los Islotes is a small set of rocks just to the north of Isla Partida. Los Islotes is home to a sea lion colony of more than 200 permanent members and several seabird species.&nbsp;We will approach Los Islotes with our Zodiacs to get a closer look at the different animals and rock formations and will offer an opportunity to swim and snorkel with the sea lions. </p>\n<p>Espiritu Santo was declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1995, with Isla Partida separated from Espiritu Santo only by a narrow winding channel. A sand bar is said to connect the two islands at low tide. Many long bays seem to be dividing the island of Espiritu Santo. Steep cliffs, azure blue water and white sand make for some of the most beautiful beaches in Mexico. Apart from enjoying the water, walks ashore might also be offered. <br />\n  &nbsp;<strong></strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 3 — Isla San Pedro, Mexico</strong><br />\n  During the night <em>Silver Explorer</em> will have entered further into the Gulf of California, heading north. This afternoon we will be off Isla San Pedro for Zodiac cruises around the guano-covered island. This steep rock coming almost straight out of the sea is one of the few islands in the Sea of Cortez to have a permanent group of seabirds – Brown and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, pelicans and cormorants and Magnificent Frigatebirds as visitors. It was mainly because of the hundreds of thousands of Brown and Blue-footed Boobies and the resulting guano on the island that the difficult to reach island was mined. These days a landing is prohibited to protect the nesting sites of the birds and the island itself is protected by Mexican law and included in the UNESCO World Heritage list –together with 243 other islands in the Sea of Cortez. Bottlenose dolphins can be found around the island as well as one of the three great pods of sperm whale in the Gulf of California. Californian sea lions have made this island their home and form the third largest colony in the gulf –something that will not only be seen but heard as well. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Isla Partida and Isla San Esteban, Mexico</strong><br />\n  Today, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will be off two more of the Midriff Islands and we will go ashore to search for desert birds and some of the endemic lizards following the dry riverbeds. Remains of the local Seri natives can be found in several areas, indicating that they managed to cover major distances across the Gulf of California, looking for resources and establishing shelters and small settlements.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Isla Santa Catalina, Mexico<br />\n  </strong>Santa Catalina is one of several islands in the Loreto Bay National Park (Parque Nacional Bahia Loreto).<br />\n  The sea surrounding Santa Catalina has manta rays and several large pods of bottlenose, spinner and long-beaked common dolphins, as well as short-finned pilot whales and we hope to not only see them from the outer decks of <em>Silver Explorer</em>, but also from our Zodiacs. </p>\n<p>In the afternoon we will go ashore at Isla Santa Catalina and will search for marine life and offer various hikes. We will hike into the Cardon cactus forest. Standing next to the various cacti –and especially the Santa Catalina barrel cactus- can be quite impressive. On the Cardon cactus we will look for Gila Woodpeckers and other birds that use the plant for food or as a resting place. There are several interesting animal species on the island, including the endemic Santa Catalina rattleless rattlesnake. The Santa Catalina whiptail lizard, the common desert spiny lizard, Santa Catalina desert iguana, and other reptiles make for interesting photography.</p>\n<p>If the water is not too cold for you, snorkelling will be another option. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Isla San Jose and Isla San Francisco, Ecuador</strong><br />\n  Exploration and discovery await us as we anchor off the coast of Isla San Jose with its 170 square kilometres. We intend to explore the mangroves on San Jose’s southern side and will take our Zodiacs into the lagoon and channel in search of shorebirds and waders. The Yellow-footed Gull is one of the resident seabirds. </p>\n<p>At Isla San Francisco we will find a beautiful desert beach on its southwestern side with excellent snorkelling and a nearby sea lion colony. We will offer various shore hikes looking for fauna and flora for those wanting to stretch their legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 7-8 — Topolobampo, Mexico</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will arrive quite early to Topolobampo where you will have the choice to either visit the famous Copper Canyon by train on an overnight excursion seeing a series of massive canyons in the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains, or to visit local indigenous groups and El Fuerte, the home of El Zorro. </p>\n<p>In either case you will have to drive to El Fuerte, as the train ride to Copper Canyon will start from there.<br />\n  At El Fuerte you will board your privately chartered train on the Chihuahua Pacifico Railway. Enjoy a leisurely morning and a continental boxed breakfast on board the train while you traverse the magnificent Sierra Madre Mountain range, and eventually enter the Copper Canyon – four times larger than the Grand Canyon and only accessible by rail. Your approximately six-hour rail journey will wind through tunnels and bridges as you climb from sea level to 7,200 feet. Traveling along the rails sometimes over 1,475 feet above the ground, the journey covers a distance of 400 miles over 37 bridges and through 86 tunnels. You will stay at the Mirador Hotel overlooking Copper Canyon. The Mirador Hotel is located at the canyon’s edge, near the highest point of the canyon. The Mirador is the only hotel where each guest room has a spectacular view overlooking the canyon –claimed to be one of the ten best views in the world. &nbsp;Located in the middle of the legendary Sierra Madre Mountains of the Mexico’s state of Chihuahua, this immense series of canyons and ridges covers 25,000 square miles of rugged territory. We will explore the area and might get to see the Cusarare Falls. </p>\n<p>While staying at the Mirador we will also witness a Tarahumara dance presentation. At present the Tarahumara -a reclusive tribe that has chosen to live apart from modern western culture, subsisting on corn, beans, and their livestock- constitute the largest indigenous group in the state of Chihuahua. </p>\n<p>If you prefer to stay aboard <em>Silver Explorer</em> and still see part of the enchanting region of Mexico, join us for a scenic drive to the 450-year-old town of El Fuerte, once a flourishing trading post for silver and gold miners. First we will drive to Teheuco, home to the Mayo Indians. There you will be treated to a lively and colourful folkloric dance and an exhibition of handcrafted bowls, utensils, handicrafts and pottery. <br />\n  From Teheuco it is a short drive to El Fuerte, renowned as the birthplace of Zorro, the fictional outlaw hero, made famous in Johnston McCulley's 1919 novel “The Curse of Capistrano” and several Hollywood movies. We will have a savoury lunch at the Posada del Hidalgo Hotel, believed to have been the original home of Don Diego de la Vega, Zorro's true identity. This majestic colonial mansion was the largest and most beautiful manor in El Fuerte when it was built in 1890.</p>\n<p>Following lunch, enjoy the elaborate costumes, lively music and spirited dances of a folkloric group. Zorro himself just may make an appearance.</p>\n<p>Then have a leisurely walking tour along the colonial town’s narrow, orderly streets past architectural masterpieces when the town was known as a major sugar cane producer. Another highlight is the lovely 18th century baroque-style cathedral on Plaza de Armas, a picturesque park complete with palm trees and wrought iron gazebo.</p>\n<p>On the second day we will get to see the area north of Topolobampo -one of the most important farming areas in Mexico and home to major crops such as sugarcane, cotton, rice, and flowers. Not only will you get a taste of the region but you will also visit Los Mochis’ Regional Museum. Originally founded in 1893 by the American socialist Albert Owen, the city gained recognition in 1901 when businessman Benjamin F. Johnston built his first sugar mill here, which grew to become the largest sugarcane empire on the American continent. Continuing past lush farmland, we arrive at La Carambola Hacienda, home to a mango plantation. We will tour the plantation and learn how this sweet, juicy fruit was brought here in the 17th century and later cultivated. After the tour, you will be able to sample a variety of sweet treats such as mango ice cream, mango candy and mango marmalade. Then, you will return to the hacienda where you can try your hand at cooking authentic Mexican staples such as corn tortillas, beans and cheese.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 9 — Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur, Mexico</strong><br />\n  Cabo San Lucas is often referred to as Land’s End -as it is located on the southernmost tip of the Baja Peninsula. <br />\n  Use the afternoon to set sail on a spacious catamaran for a scenic cruise in the Sea of Cortez to beautiful Chileno Bay. Anchored in turquoise waters you can snorkel over a reef that is home to colourful marine life. As the sails are hoisted for the return, relax onboard with complimentary snacks and an open bar. <br />\n  Another option will take you to a quaint sea-side ranch where horses will be waiting for you.&nbsp; After brief instructions, you will begin a leisurely one-hour beach ride along a secluded beach.&nbsp; A short ride to the beach -where you are met by the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean- will then take you atop a bluff.&nbsp; The contrast between desert and sea is spectacular if experienced on horseback.</p>\n<p>Looking for a different perspective of the cape region you can be driven north to San Jose del Cabo. The bus ride shows Baja California’s striking appearance, from its arid desert setting and white sand coves, to its swaying palm trees and the deep blue sea. At the picturesque San Jose del Cabo you will visit the local mission church and its shady tree-lined plaza; the town even has an old opera house, now converted to a popular local restaurant.</p>\n<p>If you would like to kayak in the bay, you can opt to do so to take your sea-kayak past Los Arcos to reach renowned Lovers Beach –a strip of land connecting the Sea of Cortez with the Pacific Ocean. <br />\n  Another way to explore the bay and sea would be aboard a comfortable motorized catamaran for a coastal cruise along the Sea of Cortéz and Pacific Coast. Refreshments and snacks are served on board the boat. En route, take in breathtaking landscapes, pristine beaches, secluded coves and the famous arch at Land’s End, along with the spectacular golf resorts and residential developments. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 10-11 — At Sea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail from Cabo San Lucas along the west coast of Baja California. Take the time to look for cetaceans and seabirds, attend lectures about Baja California and California, or edit the many photos you have taken during the exploration of the Sea of Cortez.<br />\n  Relax on the outer decks and enjoy cooking demonstrations and wine tastings offered by our Executive Chef and Head Sommelier. </p>\n<p>The onboard Videographer will present the voyage DVD and the Captain will invite you to the Farewell Cocktail Party and Farewell Dinner.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — San Diego, USA<br />\n</strong>After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer.</em></p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — San Diego, California, USA</strong><br />\n  Embark the <em>Silver Explorer</em> and depart on your exciting Silversea Expedition — “Wild Coast of the Pacific USA”. </p>\n<p>Once you have settled in and before <em>Silver Explorer</em> leaves San Diego, you will attend a mandatory safety drill. Later this afternoon you will be introduced to important members of the crew and to your Expedition Team. In the evening enjoy the delights of a specially prepared menu in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 </strong><strong>— Santa Cruz, California, USA</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Our first stop will be in the Channel Islands National Park on Santa Cruz -the largest of the islands. Using a local catamaran we will head for Prisoners Harbor and the Central Valley, which despite its name is located on the northern shore. The island used to have a ranch, but is now partly owned and managed by The Nature Conservancy, while the pier, the beach and the eastern part of Santa Cruz Island are owned by the National Park Service. You can view the historic Prisoners Harbor area and search for the endemic Island Scrub-Jay which is generally found in nearby trees or stream-side vegetation, and is especially abundant in canyons and on north facing slopes with oaks. There will be different options for hikes –from short to long, from easy to strenuous. Walk up the Navy Road for a short distance to get a nice view from above. The Pelican Bay Trail will head in a northwesterly direction. During the moderate to strenuous hike we will pass California lilac bushes&nbsp;and will be on the look-out for Bald Eagles, Golden Eagles, the Island Scrub Jay and the Santa Cruz Island Fox.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 </strong><strong>— Monterrey, California, USA</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Our next stop promises an interesting day on California’s coast. We will drive along spectacular Highway 1 to Big Sur south of Monterey. During this full day excursion we will see Pebble Beach with its gorgeous coastline and homes, will stroll quaint Carmel-By-The-Sea, reach the iconic Bixby Creek Bridge and will enjoy the area’s secluded beaches, hopefully spotting Northern elephant seals hauled out on land or swimming in the adjacent surf. Lunch will be had in Carmel.<br />\n  If you prefer to do a half day excursion only, then you can choose to either see the Monterey Aquarium with a VIP behind-the-scenes experience and hear about the Aquarium's groundbreaking research efforts with marine wildlife, or choose a more active afternoon of hiking or a 3-hour kayaking experience.</p>\n<p>An optional excursion will be to play one round of golf at the legendary Pebble Beach Golf Links.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 </strong><strong>— San Francisco, California, USA</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Today a full day tour of San Francisco and the Bay Area will take you to Muir Woods and the rolling hills of the Marin County Headlands. On the return to the city of San Francisco you will cross the Golden Gate on the world-famous Golden Gate Bridge. The highlights in San Francisco will include Golden Gate Park, Fisherman’s Wharf and Haight-Ashbury.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to see San Francisco’s highlights during the morning for an afternoon of your own, take the morning excursion to explore eclectic neighbourhoods, visit Haight-Ashbury, the Golden Gate Recreation Area’s Land’s End and finish at the ferry Building Market for further independent exploration.</p>\n<p>Once <em>Silver Explorer</em> leaves the berth you should be out on deck as we pass Alcatraz Island and will head out to sea passing under the Golden Gate Bridge shortly before sunset. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 </strong><strong>— At sea</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  During our day at sea, let our lecturers recap the things seen and done in California and prepare you for the natural wonders and historical sites we will see in Oregon and Washington. Enjoy a cigar in the Connoisseurs Corner or scones in the Panorama Lounge.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 </strong><strong>— Astoria, Oregon, USA</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Our next stop on this voyage is at the mouth of the Columbia River. Here we will have the option to see Fort Stevens, the only military installation in the continental United States to be fired upon since the War of 1812, in either an in-depth behind-the-scenes visit or doing a bike tour focusing on the historical and geographical attraction, including Battery Russel with its great panoramic views. Another half day excursion will visit the mouth of the Columbia River and from Fort Stevens will continue south to Cannon Beach for magnificent views of an iconic monolith known as Haystack Rock. Alternatively join a tour to Fort Clatsop State Park – where Lewis &amp; Clark spent the winter of 1805-1806 and tour a re-creation of the Fort.&nbsp; Enjoy an interpretive walk through coastal rainforest before enjoying a beer tasting at Fort George Brewery with a special presentation by a Lewis and Clark historian. <br />\n  In the evening <em>Silver Explorer</em> will start our cruise up the Columbia River.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 </strong><strong>— Rainier, Oregon, USA</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Rainier is due west of Mount St. Helens and during our morning we will take the Lewis and Clark Bridge, crossing into Washington to explore Mt. St. Helens Volcanic Monument. This monument certainly is one of the most powerful reminders of nature’s forces, and naturalists will share stories of the drama of the May 18, 1980 eruption –the most deadly and destructive eruption in the history of the United States. You will experience how volcanoes are monitored and what Mt. St. Helens has taught. At the Johnston Ridge Observatory birds-eye views into the still-steaming crater can be had and on a hike diverse birdlife and possibly deer, elk and beavers can be observed.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 </strong><strong>— At sea</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail downstream to reach the Pacific and head north.<br />\n  Have a leisurely breakfast, attend a lecture, seminar or workshop, and take the time on the outer decks to look for seabirds, dolphins and whales. Relax in one of the lounges, enjoy a cocktail with fellow travellers or read a book in the well-stocked library.</p>\n<p>Our culinary team will prepare and offer delicious choices using local produce.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 </strong><strong>— Port Angeles, Washington, USA</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Port Angeles is located on the southern side of the Strait of Juan de Fuca opposite Victoria and next to Olympic National Park. To make the most of the day we will drive to the summit of Hurricane Ridge at 1,598 meters above sea level for stunning views of the Olympic Peninsula, Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Interpretive hikes will be offered to spot wildlife in this unique alpine habitat. Afterwards you can either head for an old-growth forest at Lake Crescent and end the day soaking in the Sol Duc Hot Springs, or explore Dungeness Spit beach walking and getting to know about the local shellfish farms, concluding at the Finn River Farm to learn about organic farming on the peninsula with a chance to sample the local wine with light appetizers. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 </strong><strong>— Olympia, Washington, USA</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  From Washington State’s capital Olympia we will be heading west on a full day excursion to see and hike at iconic Mount Rainier in Mount Rainier National Park. After a two-hour drive we will be able to see Alpine meadows, lakes, waterfalls, old growth forests, all combined with geology and volcanology –the 14,410 foot iconic Mount Rainier is an active volcano. </p>\n<p>If you prefer to hike a little closer to Olympia, you can choose to do so at the Mima Mounds, a National Natural Landmark some 30 miles south of Olympia. You will hike a 1.5-mile loop trail through low-growing prairie grasses and learn about the Native Americans who inhabited this area. This half-day excursion will end with a scenic walk through various habitat types out to the tidal flats of Puget Sound at Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 </strong><strong>— Anacortes and Friday Harbour, San Juan Island, Washington, USA</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Heading north, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will reach the San Juan Islands and Anacortes. <br />\n  Anacortes is the main city on Fidalgo Island and a starting point for a visit to most other San Juan Islands. Fidalgo Island is the eastern-most island of the San Juan Archipelago and has an easy access via bridge to the mainland. Of Fidalgo’s 15.4 square miles almost half are public park and recreational lands. The 67 miles of trails throughout Anacortes and Fidalgo Island encompass Mount Erie, four fresh-water lakes, one of the last old-growth forested areas on the coast and a variety of wildlife, including Bald Eagles. This is a place to explore the northern woods at your own or you can choose between a visit Deception State Park for nature walks, continue on to Whidbey Island and Fort Casey State Park, a coast artillery post featuring two 10-inch and two 3-inch historic guns and have a look at the Admiralty Head Lighthouse with sweeping views of Admiralty Inlet and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, as well as visiting Penn Cove mussel farms to sample this local delicacy or to see the wildlife-rich waters of Deception Pass in between the two islands by local boat. </p>\n<p>If that is not enough of a workout for you, how about kayaking to see seals, porpoises, eagles and possibly killer whales?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During lunch<em> Silver Explorer</em> will relocate a short distance and will anchor between Shaw and San Juan Island for a visit to Friday Harbour. Wander the docks in Friday Harbor during an afternoon of self-exploration and relaxation. Watch at the boats, enjoy a walk down the waterfront, and look for the sculpture of Popeye, a female harbor seal that has been a frequent visitor to Friday Harbor.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 12 </strong><strong>— Vancouver, Canada</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Vancouver, Canada</strong><br />\n  Embark the <em>Silver Explorer</em> and depart on your exciting Silversea Expedition — “America’s Western Frontier”. </p>\n<p>Once you have settled in and before <em>Silver Explorer</em> leaves Vancouver, you will attend a mandatory safety drill. Later this afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p>\n<p><em>Silver Explorer</em> will stay in Vancouver until dinnertime; therefore you can enjoy the delights of a specially prepared menu in The Restaurant in calm conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 </strong><strong>— Friday Harbour and Lopez Island, San Juan Islands, Washington, USA</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Heading south, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will have reached the San Juan Islands during the early morning. Friday Harbour offers two very different options: either transfer to scenic and historic Roche Harbor on the island’s north coast for a whale and wildlife-watching boat excursion looking for orca pods, Dall’s porpoises, harbour porpoises, minke and gray whales, harbour seals, Bald Eagles, and Rhinoceros Auklets; or discover San Juan’s remote wilderness with a naturalist guide –during the excursion an island winery or lavender farm will also be visited.</p>\n<p>Lopez Island is quite rural and has a small village north of Fisherman Bay called Lopez Village. One can explore the village and the surrounding wetlands and parks, see the Museum and enjoy the friendly atmosphere of the island.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 </strong><strong>— Anacortes and Cypress Island, Washington, USA</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  From Lopez Island to Anacortes on Fidalgo Island is just a short sail and <em>Silver Explorer</em> will be arriving quite early in the morning.</p>\n<p>Fidalgo Island is the eastern-most island of the San Juan Archipelago and has an easy access via bridge to the mainland. Of Fidalgo’s 15.4 square miles almost half are public park and recreational lands. The 67 miles of trails throughout Anacortes and Fidalgo Island encompass Mount Erie, four fresh-water lakes, one of the last old-growth forested areas on the coast and a variety of wildlife, including Bald Eagles. This is a place to explore the northern woods.<br />\n  Pending permission from the Department of Natural Resources we will take local boats to land at either Pelican Beach or Eagle Harbor and will offer various hikes on Cypress Island –a misnomer, as the trees seen when the island received its name were actually junipers. Despite an extensive trail system, the island receives a low amount of trail users and much of the area remains fairly pristine. Another option would be to do a Zodiac cruise around Cypress Island and Strawberry Island in Strawberry Bay. <br />\n  This evening <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail south -deep into Puget Sound.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 </strong><strong>— Olympia</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  From Washington State’s capital Olympia we will be heading west on a full day excursion to see and hike at iconic Mount Rainier in Mount Rainier National Park. After a two-hour drive we will be able to see Alpine meadows, lakes, waterfalls, old growth forests, all combined with geology and volcanology –the 14,410 foot iconic Mount Rainier is an active volcano. </p>\n<p>If you prefer to hike a little closer to Olympia, you can choose to do so at the Mima Mounds, a National Natural Landmark some 30 miles south of Olympia.

Afterwards you can either head for an old-growth forest at Lake Crescent and end the day soaking in the Sol Duc Hot Springs, or explore Dungeness Spit beach walking and getting to know about the local shellfish farms, concluding at the Finn River Farm to learn about organic farming on the peninsula with a chance to sample the local wine with light appetizers. </p>\n<p>If you would like to be more active, take a long excursion to hike in the Hoh Rainforest, one of the finest examples of an intact temperate rainforest, exploring the rainforest floor and mossy trees, and to paddle through Class II water in the glacier-fed Hoh River. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 </strong><strong>— Astoria, Oregon</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Our next stop on this voyage is at the mouth of the Columbia River. Here we will have the option to see Fort Stevens, the only military installation in the continental United States to be fired upon since the War of 1812, in either an in-depth behind-the-scenes visit or doing a bike tour focusing on the historical and geographical attraction, including Battery Russel with its great panoramic views.

You will experience how volcanoes are monitored and what Mt. St. Helens has taught. At the Johnston Ridge Observatory birds-eye views into the still-steaming crater can be had and on a hike diverse birdlife and possibly deer, elk and beavers can be observed.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 </strong><strong>— At sea</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Heading south our lecturers will take advantage of the time spent aboard to offer talks and seminars regarding the Pacific Northwest.</p>\n<p>When not attending a lecture, seminar or workshop, take the time on the outer decks and watch for seabirds. Relax, enjoy a cocktail or any other refreshment and see the landscape go by.<br />\n  Our culinary team will prepare and offer delicious choices using local produce.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 </strong><strong>— Eureka, California, USA</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  A State Historic Landmark, Eureka, with its meticulously preserved and restored Old Town, will show off its Victorian heritage and will be our starting point for various choices for a morning excursion:<br />\n  For the birders a birding tour of the Arcata Marsh, Humboldt Bay NWR, and other upland and coastal areas will be of interest; if you like beach hiking, then choose either the Trinidad State Beach for a hike through woods, open bluffs past seasonal wildflowers down to the beach or head for the Samoa Dunes where several stages of dune formation can be seen during your hike. </p>\n<p>If you think Eureka deserves to be explored a bit more, than take an Old Town walking tour, including theatres, pubs, antique shops and local coffee houses, as well as a little gem: the Sequoia Park Zoo, the oldest Californian Zoo (and one of the smallest), right next to some magnificent old-growth redwoods. <br />\n  Since Eureka used to be the centre of the lumber trade and redwood forests are still found all around, we will also offer an excursion to the Redwoods National Park, the Avenue of the Giants (referring to the redwood trees <em>Sequoia sempervivens</em>), and Founder’s Grove with a few very big trees –Founder’s Tree at 324.99 ft.- doing some hiking. To see the redwood trees from a different perspective choose the Trees of Mystery and the Sky Trail Gondola. This features a nearly 1/3 mile journey through the forest tree tops via the unique Sky Trail gondola ride. Nowhere else will you have the chance to get an up-close and downward perspective from the tops of redwood trees that measure 100s of feet in height. <br />\n  During the afternoon <em>Silver Explorer</em> will continue to sail southward and our onboard Videographer will take you back in time when the voyage documentary is screened in The Theatre.<br />\n  &nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 10 </strong><strong>— San Francisco, California, USA</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 -&nbsp;Seward, Alaska, USA<br />\n  </strong>As soon as all guests have embarked, a mandatory safety drill will be performed by all. This afternoon you will be introduced to important members of <em>Silver Explorer’</em>s crew and your Expedition Team. We invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and in the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant. <br />\n  During dinner we depart on our spectacular 17-day expedition “In the Footsteps of Vitus Bering”.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 –&nbsp;Holgate Glacier and Chiswell Islands, Alaska, U.S.A. </strong><br />\n  Kenai Fjords National Park’s famous Holgate Glacier will be our only chance to see a calving glacier. The glacier comes down from the Harding Ice Field and reaches the Holgate Arm of Aialik Bay. Enjoy an early morning Zodiac cruise towards the glacier. </p>\n<p>During lunch Silver Explorer will sail to the Chiswell Islands –part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The islands will give us the first chance to go out in our Zodiacs to get an up close look at Steller sea lions. Thousands of birds call these rugged islands their home and we can expect to see Horned Puffins, Tufted Puffins, Black-legged Kittiwakes, and of the auklet family the Cassin’s Auklet and the Whiskered Auklet, among others. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 –Kukak Bay and Geographic Harbour, Amalik Bay, Katmai National Park <br />\n  </strong>Katmai National Park’s landscape is breathtaking, with 15 active volcanoes, towering mountain peaks, rolling tundra, rugged, wave-battered coastlines and the largest brown bear population in the state.<br />\n  Here we have the opportunity to get up close to abundant wildlife. The entrance to Kukak Bay is quite scenic and one should be outside on deck to start searching for bears. Quite often sea otters are seen in the water drifting by. We will offer Zodiac cruises along Kukak Bay in search of wildlife and to enjoy the beautiful scenery. Good places to look for wildlife are the two river mouths. The scenery is magnificent at Geographic Harbour,<strong> </strong>at the head of Amalik Bay, and bears are even more frequent than at Kukak Bay. <br />\n  During our Zodiac cruises there usually are ample opportunities to see and photograph brown bears.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 -Semidi Islands</strong> <strong>and Chignik, Alaska, U.S.A.</strong><br />\n  The Semidi Islands form a stunning and uninhabited archipelago that is home to some of the largest populations of native and undisturbed wildlife in the United States. There are an estimated 2.5 million birds found here, considered almost half the breeding seabirds of the Alaska Peninsula. Horned Puffins, Northern Fulmars and jaegers, and over a million murres (guillemots for Europeans) have been seen -among them Ancient Murrelets and Parakeet Auklets. The surrounding sea is home to sea otters, sea lions, seals, porpoises and whales.<br />\n  <br />\n  During the afternoon <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail west towards the Peninsula and will reach Chignik. With only 91 inhabitants, Chignik is a remote fishing village with two fish plants. In summer the population doubles, as fishing gets better. We will visit the village during the late afternoon.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Unga Village, Aleutian Islands, Alaska, U.S.A.<br />\n</strong>Explore this Aleutian settlement which had been subject to a small gold rush. The village was eventually abandoned in the 1960’s and now has a somewhat sombre appearance. Many of the houses have collapsed. From a distance the church with the tower seems intact. Standing close you can see that only the roof is standing on the ground, the walls having collapsed. Great Horned Owls nest near the church. During a Zodiac-cruise in the bay kittiwakes, Double Crested and Pelagic Cormorants, as well as good numbers of Common Murres and Tufted Puffins can be seen. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 —</strong><strong> Dutch Harbour, Unalaska Island, Aleutian Islands, Alaska, U.S.A.<br />\n</strong>The Aleutians stretch 1300 miles from mainland Alaska to Kamchatka. At one time they were stepping stones for Russian trappers and traders, who established settlements on the islands. Dutch Harbour became a trans-shipping point for the gold boomtown of Nome. Today most of the islands form part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.</p>\n<p>Dutch Harbour will be one of the few places on our voyage that <em>Silver Explorer</em> will go alongside. Together with the city of Unalaska, Dutch Harbour is a bustling community with about 4,000 residents. It is connected by bridge to the rest of Unalaska on Amaknak Island and its name is frequently applied to the entire town. During our visit, we will see the World War II bunkers and the spectacular Russian Orthodox Church. Dutch Harbour is also one of the best places to see Bald Eagles.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 —</strong><strong> At sea<br />\n</strong>During our day at sea, have a leisurely breakfast, attend one of the lectures covering the North Pacific’s natural history and help our Marine Biologist watching for cetaceans or our Ornithologist looking for albatrosses and other pelagic seabirds. Relax in one of the lounges, enjoy a cigar and meet up with new friends for cocktails.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the onboard Photographer will present a workshop to help you with advice and tips for better photos and/or editing. In the evening enjoy another special dinner by our Executive Chef and his team.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8&nbsp; -Kiska Harbour, Kiska Island, Alaska, U.S.A.</strong><br />\n  While approaching the island, we search for Least and Crested Auklets, Peregrine Falcons and Laysan and Black-footed Albatrosses, all the while keeping an eye open for the sperm whales that frequent the area. We would like to do a landing and hike on the eastern shore. Evidence of the Japanese occupation during WWII is still visible at Kiska Harbour. Once ashore we see the remains of a Shinto shrine left behind by the 6000 strong occupying force. During our nature walks we hope to see Ptarmigans, Lapland Longspurs and Bald Eagles.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 – Attu, Alaska, U.S.A.</strong><br />\n  During the morning attend a lecture or scan the waters and sky for marine mammals and seabirds. Around noon we reach Attu, the westernmost point of the United States and the site of the only WWII battle fought on North American soil — over two thousand Japanese soldiers lost their lives at Massacre Bay. The island is an ornithologist’s paradise and today we hope to see some of the Asian migrants that are occasionally spotted. Be on the lookout for Peregrine Falcons, Lapland Longspur and Aleutian Canada Goose.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 10 —&nbsp;Cruising Bering Sea and crossing the dateline<br />\n</strong>A leisurely day at sea is yours to enjoy. Begin perhaps with a late breakfast and another cup of coffee or tea during the first of the day’s lectures. Join the lectures and hear fascinating tales of adventure and learn about the Russian Far East, its wildlife and remarkable nature. Our knowledgeable Lecture Staff members are experts in a variety of scientific fields. Today you will also become a time traveller: coming from the east and heading west you will cross the International Dateline actually from west to east and therefore loose a day!</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 —&nbsp;Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Russia <br />\n</strong>Petropavlovsk, the town of Peter and Paul, derives is named from the two sailing ships used by Vitus Bering when the great explorer reached Avacha Bay in 1740. It is the only major city on the peninsula and one of the oldest. Petropavlovsk is also the scientific and cultural centre of the region, and today local guides will take us on a comprehensive tour including the museum of ethnography and natural history, the art school, the gold-domed Russian Orthodox Cathedral and the marketplace.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 &nbsp; -Ruskaya Bay and Utashud Islands, Russia</strong> <br />\n  South of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy is the 15 kilometre long Ruskaya Bay. The northeast to southwest direction and narrow body of water have made this bay a perfect place to look for shelter in foul weather -and fishing fleets and WWII convoys headed for Vladivostok have made ample use of the bay. Two shipwrecks can still be seen close to the bay’s southeastern shore. A river, used as a source of freshwater in former times, meanders through the valley and with our Zodiacs we will have to see how far we can explore, or if we hike to the small stands of trees found there. </p>\n<p>In the late morning Silver Explorer will continue south towards our next stop at the Utashud Islands. <br />\n  The Utashud Islands are a small cluster of islets with spectacular scenery. The islands feature gentle slopes and steep cliffs which make them ideal habitat for various seabird species. Harbour and possibly spotted seals are plentiful along the shores.&nbsp; An old rusty ship wreck could be seen on the southwestern side of one of the island slabs. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 — Atlasova Island, Russia</strong><br />\n  A stretch of 800 miles separates the southern end of the Kamchatka Peninsula and Hokkaido in Japan.&nbsp; The Kuril chain of over 30 volcanic islands is an important breeding ground for Steller sea lions and one of the richest areas in the world for seabirds; up to 14 species of auks, as well as Spectacled and Pigeon Guillemots can be found in the islands. </p>\n<p>With 6,500 ft. (2,000 m) Alaid is the highest volcano in the Kurils. The volcano is praised by the Japanese for its almost perfect volcanic cone. We land by Zodiac on the black lava beach for a walk to see the remains of the Taketomi tufa cone and the women's prison, or gulag. Women, many of them political prisoners during the Soviet rule, were sent here to raise foxes for fur.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 — </strong><strong>Lovyshky Island and Yankicha Island, Russia</strong> <br />\n  During a morning Zodiac cruise we will search for northern fur seals and Steller sea lions around this cluster of small islands and rocky outcrops. Here you should have excellent views of auklets too! Aboard our Zodiacs we can normally drift among the Whiskered, Crested and Parakeet Auklets. Tufted Puffins with their colourful bills and flowing yellow head plumes are also around.<br />\n  <br />\n  After the Zodiac cruise at Lovyshky, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail south for the impressive island of Yankicha. Its sinking volcanic caldera is accessible on its southern side only by Zodiac and only during high tide. Inside the magnificent lagoon with its fumaroles and hot springs, we can still see traces of the tremendous forces that created the island long ago and a visit here is invariably one of the highpoints of the entire voyage. The number of the breeding auklets is truly incredible. If we are lucky we may also catch a glimpse of an Arctic fox. For spectacular views –weather permitting- we will hike up the crater’s flank.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 15 — Chirpoy Island, Russia</strong> <br />\n  During the early morning we take our Zodiacs to search along the coast for the profusion of wildlife that lives in the area -including Steller sea lions, Northern Fulmars, kittiwakes, puffins and auklets. <br />\n  In the afternoon you can attend another lecture or seminar and prepare yourself for tomorrow’s visit to one of the seal and sea lion hotspots in the Russian Far East. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 16 — </strong><strong>Tyuleniy Island, Russia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n</strong>Tyuleniy means “seal” in Russian, and during the summer months the island is home to literally tens of thousands of northern fur seals and Steller sea lions. Our visit at the height of the breeding season is timed to see not only the seals and sea lions, but also the Black-legged Kittiwake, Tufted Puffin, Common Murre and Pelagic Cormorant that summer on the island.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 17 - Korsakov, Sakhalin Island, Russia<br />\n</strong>Our last stop in the Russian Far East is Korsakov. We will not only clear out of Russia, but will also take the time to see the area’s highlights. We will explore part of the city that was founded in 1853 as Sakhalin's first Russian military post. From Korsakov we drive to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the capital of the island with a population of just over 160,000. Founded as a small Russian settlement in the 1880s, the city became a Japanese prefect capital when the southern half of Sakhalin was declared a Japanese colony in 1905. After WWII the island was returned to Russia. Highlights include a visit to the Russian Orthodox Church, the Regional Museum housed in an impressive former Japanese mansion, and the bustling market. Enjoy a performance of traditional Cossack song and dance.</p>\n<p>Do not miss the presentation of the voyage’s DVD by our onboard Videographer, and join your fellow travellers for the Farewell Cocktail hosted by the Captain.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 17 — Otaru, Hokkaido, Japan <br />\n</strong>After clearance into Japan and following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<strong>Day 1 — Otaru, Japan<br />\n</strong>Once all guests have embarked, a mandatory safety drill will be conducted before <em>Silver Explorer</em> leaves Otaru.\n<p>You will then be introduced to important members of the crew and your Expedition Team. Afterwards we have a sail away cocktail while we depart on our spectacular expedition “Expedition Kurils and Kamchatka”. </p>\n<p>Tonight we invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers, and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 2 — Korsakov, Russia<br />\n  </strong>During the morning you can relax, have a leisurely breakfast and attend the first of several lectures about the Russian Far East, its history, its people and above all its wildlife.</p>\n<p>Korsakov once served as a penal colony and achieved literary fame after a travel report by Anton Chekhov. We will have enough time to get a glimpse of this city during an afternoon excursion with a cultural program. We intend to see Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk's beautiful Cathedral of the Resurrection. The church was only completed in 1995, and the gold on the onion domes has very recently been laid, shining brilliantly. From the church continue to the Sakhalin Regional Museum, which is housed in a beautiful Japanese-style structure, due to the previous ruling of its southern neighbour. The museum covers all the facets of Sakhalin Island, from its flora and fauna, to its geology and history and its indigenous populations. At the Gagarin Park, with its adventure playgrounds and numerous beer and barbeque spots, the afternoon might end with a traditional performance of Russian song and dance. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 3 - Tyuleniy Island<br />\n  </strong>Located off the East coast of Sakhalin Island in the Sea of Okhotsk, we can witness a natural paradise – this small island of only 2 sq. kilometres is an ideal place to observe large colonies of estimated more than 250,000 Northern fur seals and Steller sea lions, as well as tens of thousands of Common Guillemots and Black-legged Kittiwakes that have made their nests in the cliffs above.&nbsp;We will take our Zodiacs to cruise along the shore and marvel at the unbelievable amount of birds and mammals.<br />\n  &nbsp;<br />\n  <strong>Day 4 – At sea</strong><br />\n  Our lecturers will take this day at sea to present lectures, seminars, and discussions about the Russian Far East and the impact human exploration has had in the different areas we have seen and intend to visit. </p>\n<p>If you would like to relax, you can make use of the Spa, the Connoisseurs Corner, use the Fitness Centre or simply take in the fresh air on the Sun Deck. Enjoy lunch al fresco and meet with new friends for a cocktail.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 5 — Yankicha Island</strong><br />\n  Yankicha is a fascinating place. It is actually a flooded volcanic caldera, accessible only by Zodiac and only during high tide. Once inside the magnificent lagoon, we can still see – in the fumarole fields and hot springs – traces of the tremendous forces that created the island long ago. The island is also home to thousands of Crested Auklets and we may catch a glimpse of an Arctic fox or even the rare and elusive Whiskered Auklets during our nature walks.&nbsp;<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 6 – Lovyshky Islands&nbsp;and Makanrushi Island&nbsp; <br />\n</strong>With our Zodiacs we will approach the clusters of rocks that comprise this island group - home to huge populations of sea mammals and birds. At Skaly Lovyshky we will go in search of Northern fur seals and Steller sea lions and hope to get good views of the Pigeon Guillemots that often swim around the rocky outcrops of the islands.</p>\n<p>Makanrushi, our evening stop, is another uninhabited volcanic island. North of the Evreinov Strait, It is a roughly rectangular island with almost 50 sq. kilometres. As there are no sandy beaches, but mostly steep cliffs, we will intend a ship or Zodiac cruise along the shore and hope to have good views of the island’s highest peak. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 7 — Atlasova Island and Utashud</strong><br />\n  Alaid on Atlasova Island is the highest volcano in the Kuril chain with a height of over 2,000 metres. Together with our expedition staff we land by Zodiac on the black lava beach of the island, from where we will begin our walk to see the remains of the Taketomi tufa cone.</p>\n<p>In the late morning <em>Silver Explorer</em> will continue north towards our next stop at the Utashud Islands. <br />\n  The Utashud Islands are a small cluster of islets off the coast of Kamchatka with spectacular scenery. The islands feature gentle slopes and steep cliffs which make them ideal habitat for various seabird species. Harbour and possibly spotted seals are plentiful along the shores.&nbsp; An old rusty ship wreck could be seen on the southwestern side of one of the island slabs. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Ruskaya Bay, Russia</strong> <br />\n  South of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy is the 15 kilometre long Ruskaya Bay. The northeast to southwest direction and narrow body of water have made this bay a perfect place to look for shelter in foul weather -and fishing fleets and WWII convoys headed for Vladivostok have made ample use of the bay.

A river, used as a source of freshwater in former times, meanders through the valley and with our Zodiacs we will have to see how far we can explore, or if we hike to the small stands of trees found there. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 9 — Zhupanova River,&nbsp; Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia<br />\n  </strong>By cruising the river with our highly manoeuvrable Zodiacs, we will have the ability to stop and go ashore wherever we expect to find the best birding and nature walks. Heading upstream, we are likely to spot up to 40 different bird species and may even see brown bears fishing for salmon in the river. Our main goal today is to spot Steller Sea Eagles. This majestic bird is known to frequent this area, and we hope to have good views of at least one of the eagles.&nbsp;<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 10 — Commander Bay, Bering Sea<br />\n  </strong>The Komandorskiye or Commander Islands are named after famed Commander Vitus Bering who had been commissioned by the Russian Tsar to search for a land bridge between Asia and America. After having been to Alaska he was forced to overwinter here. He was buried on the island, but part of the crew managed to return to Petropavlovsk. We will try to go ashore to see the graves of Bering and some of his crew.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 11 — Nikolskoye, Komandorskiye Islands, Bering Sea. </strong><br />\n  Today we intend to visit a Steller sea lion rookery on the north side of Cape Severozapadniy. If we manage to land, we will walk along a sometimes waterlogged dirt road which leads to a blind overlooking the rookery. Apart from the sea lions arctic foxes can often be seen – they are curious, and will watch us from a safe distance.&nbsp;<br />\n  <br />\n  Before lunch <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail to Nikolskoye, which was established in 1826 by fur traders. This fishing village on Bering Island has colourful buildings and an Orthodox Church -one of Russia’s newest and one of the eastern-most- and a small museum where we will learn about the Aleut people and their culture. It also contains much information on Bering, as well as the bones of a Steller’s sea cow. During our visit we will enjoy a concert and be entertained by a presentation of local games. &nbsp;<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 12 — At sea and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Russia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  </strong>We will spend the last day aboard <em>Silver Explorer</em>, sailing for Petropavlovsk, the only major city on the peninsula and one of the oldest towns in the Russian Far East. It is also the scientific and cultural centre of the region, with a museum of ethnography and natural history, an art school, a gold-domed Orthodox cathedral.<br />\n  &nbsp;<br />\n  Aboard <em>Silver Explorer</em> attend final lectures and discussions about the area you have travelled through, edit some of the many photos taken and join the onboard Videographer for the documentary of our voyage along the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka.</p>\n<p>We will arrive in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy in the late afternoon.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 — Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Russia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n</strong>After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

If we manage to land, we will walk along a sometimes waterlogged dirt road which leads to a blind overlooking the rookery. Apart from the sea lions arctic foxes can often be seen – they are curious, and will watch us from a safe distance. </p>\n<p>Before lunch <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail to Nikolskoye, which was established in 1826 by fur traders.

During our visit we will enjoy a concert and be entertained by a presentation of local games. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 – At Sea </strong><br />\n  While <em>Silver Explorer</em> cruises the Bering Sea, help our birders looking for albatrosses or learn a few tips for better editing your photographs by our onboard Photographer. <br />\nAttend a lecture by one of our specialists and test your knowledge at Team Trivia. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 - Yuzhnaya Glubokaya and Lavrova Bay or Tintikyn Lagoon</strong><br />\n  During the early morning we will arrive at Yuzhnaya Glubokaya, where we might do a short Zodiac cruise and we will visit an abandoned fishing village that today is covered in wildflowers. This is an area well-liked by brown bears and activities will much depend on their presence.<br />\nDepending on tidal conditions we will either do a Zodiac cruise in Lavrova Bay or at Tintikyn Lagoon. Lavrova Bay features a Russian shipwreck dating back to the 1970’s and another abandoned fish camp where we offer a Zodiac cruise and short nature walk. The entrance to Tintikyn Lagoon is extremely tidal dependant, and we will only be able to enter at rising tide. The mountains surrounding the lagoon are well liked by brown bears and, in case we could enter the lagoon, we should be able to spot them grazing on the slopes. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 – Pyotr Bay and Bogoslav Island</strong><br />\n  During the morning <em>Silver Explorer</em> will still be at sea, giving our lecturers time for a talk or seminar. Shortly before noon we will arrive at our destination. Named after one of the ships used for the Bering expedition, Pyotr Bay is a sheltered bay and offers two hikes: one near the lighthouse close to the entrance of the bay with little climbing and only a short distance to cover; the other at the end of the bay, heading towards two lakes situated well above sea-level. While Largha seals can be expected at the first landing, the other promises a longer hike, spectacular landscape and more birding.<br />\nIn the afternoon we plan to cruise and explore Bogoslav’s shore by Zodiac. Arches and caves will be found along the coast around most of the island and we hope to see a walrus haul-out and Slaty-backed Gulls, Pigeon Guillemots, Black-legged Kittiwakes, Tufted Puffins, Horned Puffins, Common Guillemots, and Harlequin Ducks.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 - Anastasia Bay, Russia</strong><br />\n  We plan to cruise and explore this region by Zodiac, hoping to see a walrus haul-out and seals. Birders will be on the lookout for Slaty-backed Gulls, Pelagic Cormorants, Horned Puffins, Tufted Puffins, Black-legged Kittiwakes, and White Wagtails, White-fronted Geese, Bean Geese and Whooper Swans.<br />\nDepending on the conditions we might go ashore by Zodiac for nature walks amid a landscape surrounded by conical peaks and jagged cliffs, separated by valleys with lakes, waterfalls and tumbling streams and glimpses of arctic voles and ground squirrels. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 – At Sea</strong><br />\nWhile <em>Silver Explorer</em> heads north you have another opportunity to learn more about this remote part of the world, its nature and its inhabitants. Attend a lecture, partake in a seminar, or perhaps watch our chef prepare a delicacy before lunch. There are many ways to spend a relaxing day at sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 – Yttygran and Proliv Senyavina Hot Springs, Russia</strong><br />\n  Yttygran offers a unique natural history experience on this voyage. An array of bowhead whale bones and rock arrangements is stunning – it is a place of great archaeological importance combined with natural beauty. An early morning landing will add to the magic and mystery of the place due to the soft hues and the muffled light conditions. For the more energetic passengers a hike up the steep nearby hill provides an excellent leg stretch.<br />\nDuring lunch <em>Silver Explorer</em> will reposition to be closer to the Proliv Senyavina Hot Springs. We will go ashore by Zodiac, will enter a small lagoon and hike across tundra and some rolling hills to reach a stream with some hot springs. You can choose to either enter a small pool prepared by the local fishermen, or to go into the stream. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Provideniya, Russia (Cross the International Date Line and gain a day)</strong><br />\n  In Provideniya we will only stop for our outward clearance. While the Russian authorities make sure all formalities are completed, we will start our last day on board with final lectures, summing up our experiences during the last 11 days. Though today is technically considered Day 12 of our voyage, it is one very “short” day that includes approximately 19 hours of cruising the Bering Sea and crossing the International Date Line. We will actually arrive in Alaska before we left Provideniya –thanks to 24 hours gained crossing the International Dateline from west to east. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 13 — Nome, Alaska, USA</strong><br />\nAfter breakfast, disembark <em><em>Silver Explorer</em></em>.</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity.

Join us at a Sail Away cocktail party as we depart on our spectacular expedition: “East Siberian Sea Exploration”. During the afternoon you will be introduced to important members of the crew and your Expedition Team. We invite you to familiarize yourself with your new home away from home and meet some of your fellow travellers. In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 2 — Provideniya, Russia</strong> <strong> </strong><br />\n  During the morning we will be approaching Provideniya. Once we have cleared into Russia, we will start our walking tour of this former military outpost. Many of the houses have been abandoned, but those inhabitants that stayed behind seem to be optimistic that Provideniya will once again be an important port –most probably for the Northeast Passage. <br />\n  We will have a look at the very well-presented collections of the local museum, and will be entertained by local and Russian songs and dances. For those inclined to more hiking, you can leave the town towards the south in direction of the cemetery for nice views of the town and bay, always accompanied by our Expedition Staff.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 3 — Cape Dezhnev and Uelen Village, Chukotka, Russia</strong> <br />\n  At Cape Dezhnev we will land at a small pebble beach. The Cape was named East Cape by Captain Cook, but since it had been rounded some 130 years before Captain Cook by Semyon Dezhnev, the Russian authorities changed its name in the late 20th century. Ashore we can hike up to what is considered one of Russia’s most famous lighthouses and the monument honouring Dezhnev. The abandoned village of Aukan is nearby.</p>\n<p>The small coastal village of Uelen in Chukotka is north of Cape Dezhnev. Located next to the Uelen Lagoon it is known by the local Yupik as „Land’s End“. The village&nbsp;has a population of around 700 inhabitants. Uelen can claim to be Russia’s easternmost settlement. When during soviet times it had been decided to abandon many of the smaller settlements in favour of larger consolidated ones, Uelen was chosen as one of the four villages to take in the inhabitants of other settlements. The Chukchi and Inuit that now live here are known as excellent carvers, working in walrus, whalebone and reindeer.<br />\n  Going ashore we will have a welcome and cultural presentation with an opportunity to see many of the excellent carvings.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 – Kolyuchin Bay and Kolyuchin Island, Russia</strong><br />\n  Kolyuchin Island is the site of a famous rescue operation after a Russian icebreaker was crushed by ice nearby. Located close to the Siberian shore this island has been used as the base for a now abandoned meteorological station at its western end, while walrus hunters had a few huts on the eastern side. The island has steep, dramatic bird cliffs with Pelagic Cormorants, Thick-billed Murres and kittiwakes. Horned and Tufted Puffins will be another highlight for birders and photographers. Zodiac cruises will not only permit closer looks at the amazing amount of seabirds but also the walrus herds that frequent the shore and water surrounding Kolyuchin. Kolyuchin Bay is a huge tidal estuary area where we intend to go ashore for hiking and exploring the area. Shorebirds can be see, while on the tundra you might see ground squirrels as well as larger mammals –even brown bears are said to have been seen occasionally.<br />\n  Bowhead whales can sometimes be spotted around the island and a Zodiac cruise will be offered looking for these cetaceans. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 – At Sea</strong><br />\n  While <em>Silver Explorer</em> sails further west attend lectures about the human exploration of the area or help our naturalists on deck looking for whales and Short-tailed Shearwater that sometimes frequent the area by the thousands. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Days 6 —Ayon Island, Russia</strong><br />\n  At the eastern end of the Kolyma Gulf is Ayon Island. Its size of 2000 square kilometres permits the small local Chukchi population to herd reindeer. The village of Ayon has a school with a museum that was put together by the children of the school. Displayed are mammoth tusks, stuffed birds and some Paleo Eskimo artefacts. The Russian polar station on Ayon Island is one of the few meteorological stations still in use and is staffed by 12. </p>\n<p>Since visitors are quite rare we will be welcomed with warmth and hospitality. We will have a look at the village and will try to locate the remains of the Neolithic camps located not too far from the village. These camps indicate that reindeer hunters or herders lived here already during the first millennium AD. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 – Medvezhyi Islands</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will continue to sail through the Gulf of Kolyma. Our goal is to visit the Medvezhyi Islands (=Bear Islands), an uninhabited group of islands at the western side of the Gulf of Kolyma. It is not so much the bears, but the flora and geology that make these six islands so famous. This will be one of the places visited by us that were described by Nordenskjold in 1878. Despite the fact that fast ice surrounds the islands during much of the year, fishing is done near the islands. On Chetyrokstolbovoy flowers, lichen, mosses and mushrooms will be everywhere, but if we can land we will also see the abandoned weather station and will walk to the imposing rock spires –a round-trip distance about five kilometres to the top of the nearby hill. The major feature of them has been compared to a human couple. The height of up to 30 metres makes these geological features quite impressive and gave the island its name: Four-spires-island. A large field of boulders surrounds the spires, increasing in size with decreasing distance from the centre.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Going ashore at another of the islands we want to enjoy walking on lush grass, among ponds and many flowers and seeing the many large, frost-created mounds. Herds of reindeer can sometimes be observed, as well as the remains of human habitation, usually small semi-underground dwelling.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — At Sea</strong> <br />\n  Our lecturers might expand on the lesser known expeditions into the East Siberian Sea and the different findings. You could also make use of the comfort features Silver Explorer has to offer, visiting the Spa or Gym and enjoying the culinary specialties our chefs have prepared. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 – Dimitri Laptev Strait and Lyakhovsky Island, Russia</strong><br />\n  The Dimitri Laptev Strait connects the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea and separates the Siberian mainland from the New Siberian Islands. The New Siberian Islands had already been seen and visited in the early 18th century by Russian explorers and on Lyakovsky’s southeastern side is a meteorological station.</p>\n<p>The study of Lyakhovsky is quite famous for its cliffs, landscape and fossil finds. There are several indications that the islands had been visited thousands of years ago, and when the sea level was 100-120 metres lower that today the islands would have been part of the Great Arctic Plain. <br />\n  We plan to go ashore and have a look at the islands landscape and flora –mainly grasses, sedges and mosses. Prehistoric bones, shells and plant material have been well-preserved because of permafrost and tusks of mammoth and other megafauna’s remains –including sabre-toothed tigers- have been found on the island.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 – At Sea</strong><br />\n  Take the next two days to get a feeling for the different approaches to these frigid waters by explorers like Nansen, Nordenskjold and Amundsen. Attend lectures and sample the culinary specialties prepared for you by our chefs or enjoy the Connoisseurs Corner. </p>\n<p>Consider that several explorers tried to reach the ice to drift towards the North Pole. Our aim is to see the ice and walruses on the ice floes, polar bears and ribbon seals.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Reaching and exploring the Ice Edge</strong><br />\n  Based on the latest ice charts <em>Silver Explorer</em> will venture as far north as possible –where few others have been. We will continue searching for walrus, seals and polar bears on the ice, while our Historian might talk about De Long’s expedition and his experience in this part of the world</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Exploring the De Long Islands, Russia</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will explore the small De Long Islands, which are north of the New Siberian Islands. Like the New Siberian Islands, the De Long Islands were hills of the Great Arctic Plain. These are some of the last-discovered islands in the East Siberian Sea and received their name through the ill-fated American expedition led by De Long on the <em>Jeannette</em>. Although found by De Long and claimed for the US in 1881,the official American version holds that these islands -as they are not part of Alaska- are part of Russia.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 – At Sea</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will be heading east to reach one of the most famous islands long hidden from Western eyes. Attend seminars or lectures about the flora and fauna of the largest island in East Siberian waters. Let our historian talk about the various explorers and seafarers that went looking for land north of Chukotka.</p>\n<p>And do not forget to scan the waters for whales and seabirds from the outer decks. A good opportunity would be to have lunch at the Grill while watching the sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 – Ushakova Cape, Wrangel Island, Russia</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will be exploring Wrangel Island for three days. This protected nature area and UNESCO World Heritage Site has the largest amount of polar bears and apparently was the last place were woolly mammoth roamed. The name of the island goes back to the search for land north of the Chukchi Peninsula by Ferdinand von Wrangel. </p>\n<p>On our approach to the island we will be watching for gray whales, bowhead whales and beluga whales. The island is an important breeding ground for polar bears and walrus. Introduced mammals include musk oxen and reindeer. Both seem to thrive but numbers of reindeer are kept low so as to not disturb the nesting birds.</p>\n<p>We will land at Cape Ushakova, named after a famous Russian Arctic researcher, near the site of the main settlement, a former fishing village. Here we will pick up representatives of the nature reserve staff in compliance with the rules and regulations for Wrangel Island. During a tundra walk we will look for the rich Arctic flora that was the main reason for the island’s UNESCO World Heritage status –obviously always keeping an eye open for polar bears, musk oxen, lemmings, and reindeer.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 15 — Cape Florence and Cape Blossom, Wrangel Island, Russia </strong><br />\n  Always taking in mind that Wrangel has the largest concentration of polar bears, our landings will depend on whether they are present or not. Cape Florence will offer a walk looking for the two types of lemmings found on Wrangel, arctic foxes, Snowy Owls and obviously the tundra flora.<br />\n  Our second landing will be at Cape Blossom, the site of a Russian polar station made famous through the work of Nikita Ovsiannikov, a Russian polar bear scientist. This exposed area on the western shore of Wrangell Island is also known for its walrus congregations.</p>\n<p>Whenever conditions permit or dictate we will offer Zodiac cruises –looking for whales, walrus, polar bears and seabirds.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 16 — Krassin Bay and Cape Waring, Wrangel Island, Russia </strong><br />\n  The 3,400 year old Paleo-Eskimo camp in Krassin Bay will be one of the goals of today’s exploration. With our onboard naturalists and our Russian park rangers we will hike, looking for the remains of ancient inhabitants of Wrangel Island and will continue to look for land mammals, birds and the varied flora.</p>\n<p>Depending on your interest and willingness there will be offers for trekking enthusiasts, the leisurely strollers and those who just enjoy the view from the beach. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 17 – At Sea</strong><br />\n  Leaving Wrangel Island behind, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will head into the Bering Strait. This will be another good time to look for whales that frequent the area.</p>\n<p>Our lecturers will recap the various highlights and specialties seen in the East Siberian Sea and will prepare you for the last visit in Chukotka with further talks or seminars.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 18 – Proliv Senyavina, Chukotka, Russia</strong> <br />\n  During the early morning we cruise the Bering Strait and Bering Sea to reach Proliv Senyavina. This area is sporadically used by fishermen who have a few huts at a small lagoon. Landing ashore promises a nice tundra hike to reach some hot springs located inland. We will hike to the hot springs following an excellent track in the tundra. The track ascends a low hill and eventually rounds the crest where stone cairn marks the descent to hot springs. On our way we might spot ground squirrels and Sandhill Cranes. For those interested in more activity, our naturalists will offer a longer hike that also passes the hot springs.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 19 – Provideniya, Chukotka, Russia and crossing the Dateline (gaining a day)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> <br />\n  In the very early morning we will briefly stop in Provideniya for our outward clearance. On our way back to Alaska we will be crossing the Dateline again -this time it will work in our favour, as we will have today’s date twice. </p>\n<p>Take advantage to sleep in, be on the outer decks to look for marine mammals and seabirds, and attend one of the last lectures recapping our adventures in East Siberian waters. There surely are ways to keep you busy, be it editing your photos, making use of the Spa or Gym, or even if it “only” is sampling the culinary specialties the Hotel Department is preparing for you.</p>\n<p>Today our onboard Videographer will present our Voyage-DVD recounting all the different impressions seen and adventures had during our voyage “East Siberian Sea Exploration”. <br />\n  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 19 - Nome, Alaska, USA </strong><br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

For those inclined to more hiking, you can leave the town towards the south in direction of the cemetery accompanied by our Expedition Staff.</p>\n<p>A Zodiac cruise and visit to Plover Bay might follow in the late afternoon.<strong></strong><br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 3 – Proliv Senyavina and Yttygran Island, Chukotka, Russia</strong> <br />\n  Proliv Senyavina promises a nice tundra hike to reach some hot springs located inland. Fishermen have set up a base on the shore and use a specially prepared area once in a while. We will hike to the hot springs and take a relaxing dip.</p>\n<p>During lunch and the early afternoon we cruise the Bering Sea to reach Yttygran Island. On the northern shore of this island is the famous “Whalebone Alley” –an area with large numbers of carefully arranged skulls and whalebones. It is not only on land that we can see evidence of whales; grey whales are known to roam the seas around Yttygran and we might spot them during our approach or after our departure. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 – Kuyvyveen and Provideniya, Chukotka, Russia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> <br />\n  The Kuyvyveen bird cliffs not only show a varied bird life, but also are one of the most spectacular settings for a Zodiac cruise. We will spend the morning here to look for and photograph birds and geology. A large sheltered bay with towering cliffs composed of light-colored granite and streaked by darker rock on each side creates the spectacular scenery of Cape Kuyvyveen. A sandy beach lies at the head of the bay with rolling tundra behind. The sheer granite rocks, distinct basalt caves and arches of the cape are home to thousands of Tufted Puffins that nest in rocky crevasses. Despite the cliffs on either side of the bay being quite close together, the adjacent terrains attract different species of birds. Thick-billed Murres, Glaucous and Slaty-winged Gulls, Parakeet Auklets and Red Phalaropes frequent the dramatic rocky formations while Common Murres, Pelagic Cormorants and Black-legged Kittiwakes line the cliffs and archways. </p>\n<p>In the evening we will briefly stop in Provideniya for our outward clearance. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 – Cruising the Bering Sea (Cross the International Date Line and gain a day)</strong><br />\n  On our way back to Alaska we will be crossing the Dateline again -this time it will work in our favour, as we will have either yesterday’s date twice –or today will be tomorrow as well. Time travel is strange... <br />\n  Take advantage to sleep in, be on the outer decks to look for marine mammals and seabirds, and attend one of the lectures preparing you for the Pribilof Islands. There surely are ways to keep you busy and even if it “only” is sampling the culinary specialties the Hotel Department is preparing for you.<br />\n  &nbsp;<br />\n  <strong>Day 6 —Hall Island and St. Matthew Island, Alaska, USA</strong><br />\n  Today we will see two of the islands belonging to the Bering Sea Wilderness. At Hall Island we will spend the morning, using our fleet of Zodiacs to explore the rugged coast of this uninhabited island. Here we hope to witness the vast numbers of kittiwakes and guillemots that make their nest on the steep cliffs. Jacob’s ladder and lousewort will thrive between the auklet colonies. Be on the lookout for Arctic fox, and Horned Puffins that are regularly seen from the Zodiac.</p>\n<p>During lunch <em>Silver Explorer</em>will continue to St. Matthew Island. There you will step upon an island few have ever even heard of. Known as Alaska’s most remote location, it was designated by President Teddy Roosevelt as one of America’s first nature reserves in 1909. The focus today is on botany and birding -McKay’s Bunting, Lapland Longspur, and various seabirds are normally seen. At this time of the year the plants are alive in purple, pink and blue hues. Another treat you may see is the singing vole, endemic to St. Matthew.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — St. Paul, Pribilof Islands, Alaska, U.S.A.</strong> <br />\n  During the morning, while <em>Silver Explorer</em> will cruise the Bering Sea, enjoy a lecture about the natural history of Alaska.<br />\n  After lunch join us for a guided walk to the Salt Lagoon, Town Cove and the Rift Point fur seal haul out. The bird cliffs and seal rookery are located at the eastern edge of the island. On the way you will note the fish and crab processing plant near the water, as well as the Russian Orthodox Church standing above the town.&nbsp; <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  To check out the seals on the low side of the island we will have to use the seal blind -to peer out into the busy seal rookery without disturbing anything. The sub-adult male northern fur seals lying on the grass in front of the blind have to wait until they are large enough to stake out their own territory down on the water’s edge and collect a harem of females of their own. On the far side of the blind, the view opens up to the ocean and St. Paul’s working waterfront. In the foreground however are close to a thousand sea lions barking, wailing, posturing and rushing one another, and hundreds of pups, waiting in groups for their mothers to return from the sea.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Heading up to the bird cliffs you will be rewarded with stunningly close views of Tufted Puffins and Common Murres perched on the rocky ledges.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 —Dutch Harbour, Unalaska Island, Aleutian Islands, Alaska, U.S.A.</strong><br />\n  Together with the city of Unalaska, Dutch Harbour is a bustling community with about 4,000 residents. It is connected by bridge to the rest of Unalaska on Amaknak Island, and its name is frequently applied to the entire town. Famous for its fishing fleet and documentaries done about the catch of king crabs out of Dutch Harbour, we will have a look at life on land and the different historical aspects of Unalaska and Amaknak Islands. During our city tour, we might visit the World War II bunkers and the spectacular Russian Orthodox Church. Dutch Harbour is one of the best (or easiest) places to see Bald Eagles and today birders will have excellent views of these magnificent animals.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Unga Island, Aleutian Islands, Alaska</strong><br />\n  Unga Island had an Aleutian settlement which had been subject to a small gold rush. Unga Village was eventually abandoned in the 1960’s and now has a somewhat sombre appearance. Many of the houses have collapsed. From a distance the church with the tower seems intact. Standing close one can see that only the roof is standing on the ground, the walls having collapsed. Great Horned Owls nest near the church. During a Zodiac cruise in the bay kittiwakes, Double Crested and Pelagic Cormorants, as well as good numbers of Common Murres and Tufted Puffins can be seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Castle Bay, Alaska </strong><br />\n  Castle Bay is just around the corner from Chignik, a fishing village of just a few hundred inhabitants –much depending on the season. The name Castle Bay was given, as the great scenery and the skyline of the mountains resembles turrets and towers of a castle. With our Zodiacs we will be cruising along the two ramifications of the northwestern arm of Castle Bay, bringing us close to harbor seals, Bald Eagles, Pigeon Guillemots, Marble Murrelets, Mew Gulls, Black-legged Kittiwakes and Vega Gulls. </p>\n<p><a name=\"OLE_LINK2\"></a><a name=\"OLE_LINK1\"><strong>Day 11 — Geographic Harbour, and Kukak Bay Katmai National Park, Alaska </strong></a> &nbsp;<strong> </strong><br />\n  At Geographic Harbour and Kukak Bay we have another opportunity to get up close to wildlife. The scenery at Geographic Harbour at the head of Amalik Bay is magnificent and brown bears are ubiquitous. This is one of the prime areas in this region for bear viewing. <em>Silver Explorer’s </em>Expedition Team will lead a variety of Zodiac tours in search of bears, sea mammals and birds. Brown Bears, sea otters, Bald Eagles, Kittlitz’s Murrelets, Surf Scoters, Pigeon Guillemots, Black-billed Magpies, as well as Northwestern Crow and Golden-crowned Sparrow have all been seen here.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon Kukak Bay promises further and interesting Zodiac cruises with more brown bears, sea otters and Black Oystercatchers and Goldeneyes seen as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Chiswell Islands and Holgate Glacier, Alaska</strong> <br />\n  The Chiswell Islands –part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge- will give us a last chance to go out in our Zodiacs to get a close-up look at Steller sea lions. Thousands of birds call these rugged islands their home and we can expect to see Horned Puffins, Tufted Puffins, Black-legged Kittiwakes, and of the auklet family the Cassin’s Auklet and the Whiskered Auklet, among others. </p>\n<p>Kenai Fjords National Park’s famous Holgate Glacier will be our last chance to see a calving glacier. Enjoy he views from the outer decks as we leave the area shortly before sunset. </p>\n<p>Today our onboard Videographer will present our Voyage-DVD recounting all the different impressions seen and adventures had during our voyage “Islands of the Bering Sea and Alaskan Peninsula”. <br />\n  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 13 - Seward, Alaska, USA </strong><br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.<br />\n  <br />\n  <em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Seward, Alaska, USA</strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Explorer</em> and depart on your exciting 12-day Silversea Expedition — “Splendors of Alaska”. After settling in you will attend a safety briefing and be introduced to your Expedition Team. Weather permitting we will have a sail-away cocktail on deck.<br />\nWe invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — College Fjord and cruising Esther Passage, Alaska, USA</strong><br />\n  During the morning <em>Silver Explorer</em> will enter Prince William Sound and will be heading for an area first visited by the Harriman Expedition in 1899 -and named by the participants for prominent East Coast Colleges. Although the expedition was predominantly male it had been decided to name the tidewater and valley glaciers in a specific way: men’s colleges on the eastern side, women’s colleges on the western side.<br />\nOn our way out of College Fjord we might take a Zodiac cruise in through Esther Passage. On our portside we will see mainland Alaska, while on starboard will be Esther Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 — Cape St. Elias, Kayak Island, and Icy Bay, Alaska, USA</strong><br />\n  After cruising the Gulf of Alaska, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will approach Kayak Island, a historical landmark -as this was the only island in Alaska where Georg Steller landed during the Bering Expedition of 1740. <br />\nCape Elias, on its southern tip, not only has an automated lighthouse and a log-strewn shore, but during a Zodiac cruise a few haul-outs of Steller sea lions on the flat rocks might be spotted. Some of the island’s haul-outs are quite large, containing several huge males and their harems of females. On the water rafts of Short-tailed Shearwaters and Red-necked Phalaropes are not uncommon.</p>\n<p>During the afternoon at sea lectures will prepare you for the upcoming experiences. Perhaps you would like to know about the different expeditions that have chartered Alaska or want to find out what birds and mammals call this part of the world their home — attend one of the lectures by our experts and specialists on board.<br />\n  While we cruise the Gulf of Alaska, take the opportunity to scan the waters for whales from the outer decks. We will be getting closer and closer to the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve to which Malaspina Glacier and Hubbard Glacier belong. In the evening the Captain will take <em>Silver Explorer</em> into Icy Bay, a large scenic fjord that only opened up in the last hundred years after significant glacial reduction. Mount St. Elias should make a perfect backdrop for photographs of this bay.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Yakutat, Alaska, USA</strong><br />\nShortly after breakfast we will be in front of Hubbard Glacier –and depending on conditions will either cruise with our Zodiacs or <em>Silver Explorer</em> will be taken along the front of the Hubbard Glacier and while cruising we hope to see some glacier calvings.</p>\n<p>During the afternoon we will visit the community of Yakutat and will have the opportunity to see the indigenous St. Elias dance performance at the Alaska Native Brotherhood Hall, listening to traditional songs by the Tlingit tribe.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Elfin Cove, Inian Islands, Point Adolphus, Alaska, USA</strong><br />\n  This morning we visit the small community of Elfin Cove where you will have good opportunities to go for a walk on wooden boardwalks, exploring the unusual set-up of the village.<br />\n  At Inian Island you will be going on a spectacular Zodiac cruise, searching for some of the emblematic animals of Alaska: Bald Eagles, Steller sea lions, and humpback whales. The Zodiac cruise will permit you to be up close to the wildlife.<br />\nDuring the evening <em>Silver Explorer</em> will be near Point Adolphus, a well-known area for whale watching. Enjoy an aperitif while you are on the outer decks, looking for humpback whales as well as orcas, or simply enjoying the landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Sergius Narrows and Sitka, Alaska, USA</strong><br />\n  Today be prepared for a very early wake-up call if you want to see the Sergius Narrows which separate Chichagof and Catherine Islands.<br />\n  In the late morning <em>Silver Explorer</em> will arrive in Sitka, one of Alaska’s major fishing ports and communities. Sitka’s past has seen Tlingit settle the area thousands of years ago, Russians coming to trade in the late 18th century and the United States taking over through the Alaska purchase in 1867.<br />\n  Apart from exploring the town itself, there are trails within the Sitka National Historic Park/Totem Park that will permit you to see some of the emblematic totem poles and the Russian Bishop’s House, a National Historic Landmark.<br />\nOtherwise join a Jet-Cat wildlife viewing adventure aboard a deluxe expedition catamaran, and step ashore on a remote island to explore the rugged coast. Our expert naturalists will accompany you on your quest for whales, sea otters, puffins, Bald Eagles or even brown bears in pristine Sitka Sound. Depending on tides and weather you might also be beachcombing, looking for tide pools and tracing wildlife tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Sail Island and Wrangell Narrows, Alaska, USA</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will be at Sail Island before breakfast and we will scan the area surrounding the island for whales. Humpback whales like this area and we would like to see them from our Zodiacs. Our Marine Biologist and other experts will be looking for these leviathans during the morning and therefore be prepared to join all those interested on a Zodiac cruise at a moment’s notice.<br />\nHeading south we will pass the Wrangell Narrows at dinnertime.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Metlakatla and Ketchikan, Alaska, USA</strong><br />\n  During the morning <em>Silver Explorer</em> will be at anchor in front of Annette Island, Alaska. The Tsimshian of Metlakatla are famous for their Totem Poles. During the visit of the town we will get to see at least 12 of these emblematic pieces of art and we will experience a dance performance at their longhouse. Apart from the ceremony we will be led to the William Duncan Memorial Museum to understand their culture and history, specifically why and when they moved to Annette Island. You can also take one of the many trails around Skaters Lake getting an insight into the different plants used by the Tsimshian.<br />\n  During lunchtime <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail to reach Ketchikan.<br />\n  Ketchikan is one of the larger towns of the area and will offer a variety of exciting options. Today you may choose to participate in a truly unique “Wilderness Exploration &amp; Crab Feast” that will bring you by boat right to the heart of Southeast Alaska and the awe inspiring Tongass National Forest, ending in a crab feast you will remember.<br />\n  You may also choose to participate in a truly unique “Alaskan Wilderness Survival” program. Travel by local boat with a wilderness skills instructor to a remote island where he will lead your small group through an old-growth rainforest and show you a few tricks of the survivalist’s trade. This hands-on experience engages all in tasks like building a shelter, collecting wild edibles, and signalling from the beach.  Back aboard the vessel, you will haul sampling pots in search of the elusive (and invasive) green crab and other fascinating creatures that inhabit the ocean floor.<br />\nAlternatively depart the pier for the scenic, eight-mile (13-kilometre) coastal drive en route to the private Alaska Rainforest Sanctuary, an exclusive reserve located in the forested mountains at rustic Herring Cove. Here you will enjoy a guided rainforest walk where your guide will bring to life the local flora and fauna and provide you an in depth look at the Tongass National Rainforest.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 – Walker Cove and Rudyerd Bay, Misty Fjords, Alaska, USA </strong><br />\nLocated within the Tongass National Forest is the wilderness area and Misty Fjords National Monument. Extending over 2.3 million acres it is the largest wilderness area in Alaska’s forests and the second largest in the nation. It has been described as an almost untouched coastal ecosystem with outstanding geological features, and Misty Fjords National Monument is sometimes called “The Yosemite of the North”  -so be prepared for a broad spectrum of wildlife that we intend to see during the early morning in and around Walker Cove. During our Zodiac explorations we will be looking in the air for Marbled Murrelets, which unlike most members of the auk family nest in trees, and Bald Eagles, brown and black bears on the ground, and harbour seals and sea otters in the water. </p>\n<p>Another destination this afternoon will be Rudyerd Bay, promising interesting Zodiac cruises looking for marine mammals and birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada</strong><br />\n  Before breakfast, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will arrive in Prince Rupert, the “City of Rainbows”, our point of entry into Canada — and Canada’s “Gateway to the North”.<br />\n  Prince Rupert’s port is the deepest natural harbour in North America and ice-free all year round, making it an ideal port for cargo between Asia and North America since it is connected to the Canadian Railway, too. Fishing and lumber were once dominant, but tourism is becoming an important factor.<br />\nIn Prince Rupert coaches will meet you at the dock to take you to tour the North Pacific Cannery, the longest running cannery in British Columbia (and now a museum), to better understand part of Prince Rupert’s economy. The North Pacific Historic Fishing Village is a National Historic Site and is the most complete cannery that remains of these remote villages that once dotted the West Coast.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — At sea</strong><br />\n  While <em>Silver Explorer</em> sails south through Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound, you might attend a workshop by our Photographer to edit the many photos taken so far, or join one of our experts for final lectures regarding Alaska and British Columbia. Perhaps a wine tasting seminar is more to your liking. Make sure you get some exercise, either on the outer decks or in the Fitness Centre.<br />\nOr simply relax on the Sun Deck and enjoy being at sea. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Alert Bay, Johnstone Strait and Seymour Narrows, British Columbia, Canada</strong><br />\n  Located near the northern entrance of Johnstone Strait, Alert Bay is a small but culturally and historically very rich village on Cormorant Island (named after HMS Cormorant). The Kwakwaka’wakw are well known for their art, and especially their carvings. Not only were totem poles of importance, masks were/are central to the representation of the different characters of their dances and feature prominently. We will spend the morning in Alert and will see a cultural presentation and walk to the Memorial Totem Poles at the Namgis Burial Ground, one of the few places were the Totem Poles have not been disturbed nor removed.<br />\n  At the U’mista Cultural Centre we take a walk into the past and hear about the potlatch system and the ancient way of life. The museum holds a precious collection of masks and artefacts previously confiscated during the potlatch ban from 1884 to 1951. At the Big House we will experience traditional First Nations songs and dances. The most important of the sacred dances is the Hamat’sa or cannibal dance. This dance is the re-enactment of a young man’s possession by a cannibal spirit living at the North End of the world.<br />\nDuring the afternoon we cruise the Johnstone Strait. This spectacular waterway invites you to take in the scenery from the outer decks of <em>Silver Explorer</em>. The strait that is between 2.5 km and 5 km wide, 110 kilometres in length and is home to large numbers of orcas during the summer months. The largest member of the dolphin family, orcas (also known as killer whales) can measure nearly ten metres in length and weigh up to six tons.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 — Vancouver, Canada</strong><br />\nAfter breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity. Expedition Team members scheduled for this voyage are subject to change or cancellation.</p>\n<p><strong>GEAR UP</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not sure what to wear while onboard? <a style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #000; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://www.shiptoshoretraveler.com/silversea\">Visit our shop and gear up</a>.

During a special sail away party take say good-bye to downtown Honolulu and watch the Aloha Tower disappear in the distance. </p>\n<p>Later you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and this evening you can enjoy the delights of a specially prepared menu in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 2-4 — At sea, crossing the North Pacific</strong><br />\n  During our voyage south, unwind after your long flight to Honolulu and the first day of activities on Hawai’i. Our lecturers will introduce you to the Polynesian and Western exploration of this part of the Pacific, the wildlife to be encountered and the different cultures present today.<br />\n  Attend workshops and seminars and let our chefs prepare delicious culinary specialties on the Sun Deck or in The Theatre. </p>\n<p>We will be crossing the Dateline (for the first time) and will miss September 28 this way… </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Weston, Fanning, Kiribati</strong><br />\n  The Line Islands have been of importance to whaling and guano harvesting in the 19th century, while telecommunication and military installations have been important in the 20th century on Christmas and Malden. Because of population pressure on the main island of the Republic of Kiribati, voluntary resettlement has taken place and we will find that Fanning is now settled by some 2,000 Micronesians. <br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will drift in front of English Passage and we take our Zodiacs to go ashore near Weston Point. This is where the administration seat is and we can walk to see the local homes and their seaweed plantations. We will have the opportunity to see a folkloric presentation, acquire local souvenirs and go swimming in the protected bay just southeast of Weston Point. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — London, Christmas Island, Kiribati</strong><br />\n  Christmas Island was named by Captain Cook –and there even is a Cook Island. Used to produce copra –dried coconut meat- and as a military base in the 1940s-60s, this Christmas Island has been declared a Wildlife Refuge in 1975 and has large seabird colonies. Birders will also be interested to see the endemic Christmas Island Reed Warbler known as the Bokikokiko. Some of the 18 seabird species we hope to see include Christmas and Wedge-tailed Shearwater, Phoenix Petrels, Black Noddies and Little White Terns. Pending permission we might visit Cook Island for birding and swimming and Motu Tabu for birding –both are important breeding grounds and especially at Motu Tabu one has to be very careful where to step as Wedge-tailed Shearwater like to breed in burrows. <br />\n  One of the attractions to anglers is bonefishing in the lagoon. </p>\n<p>Day 7 — At sea<br />\n  Having visited two of the inhabited Line Islands, our lecturers will use the sea day to talk about the uninhabited islands and their importance to wildlife or the early Polynesian seafarers that not only stopped on the islands for a short while, but actually settled them during centuries.</p>\n<p>When not attending a lecture or relaxing on the Sun Deck, get help from the onboard photographer during a workshop or look for whales and dolphins. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Malden, Kiribati</strong><br />\n  When Malden was visited in 1825 it was found to be uninhabited, but Lt. Malden –after whom the island is named- discovered remains of former (Polynesian) settlements. One reason they could have survived on this island is that they found large seabird colonies of at least 11 species, including Masked, Red-footed and Brown Boobies, Lesser Frigatebirds, Sooty and Grey-backed terns, as well as Blue-grey Noddies across the island. The Polynesians could have lived off the birds, but the resulting guano was harvested from the mid-19th century until 1927. A railroad system (using sails and the prevailing winds for propulsion) was used to transport the guano to the western point of the island to be loaded onto barges. We intend to land near this point and walk or hike across the island –using in part the old railroad embankments- and to see some of the remains of the Polynesian structures. 21 archaeological sites with more than 70 structures can be found mostly occurring along the north coast. Remains of the British nuclear testing observation unit dating back to the 1950s are close to the landing site. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite an extensive white beach on Malden’s western side, swimming and snorkelling will be offered from anchored Zodiacs.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 9 — Starbuck Island, Kiribati</strong><br />\n  Seen by Captain Starbuck in 1823, it took more than 45 years before guano-digging took place on this small island. Guano harvesting stopped in the late 19th century, but when overpopulation in Tarawa forced the Kiribati government to look for resettlement areas in the late 20th century, this uninhabited island was considered for a while, even palm trees were planted –less than 30 were still growing in 2016.<br />\n  We hope to go ashore and explore the ruins of the former guano camp, look for the remains of various shipwrecks dating from the 19th century, as well as some of the seabird colonies that created the guano deposits. The WWF estimated in 2001 that –depending on the season- up to six million Sooty Terns call Starbuck their home. Starbuck has been declared a Wildlife Sanctuary, to protect the turtles that come to nest, the marine life and the 16 species of seabirds that use the island. Snorkelling off the islands shore very much depends on the sea conditions, but would be offered from our Zodiacs. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — At sea and crossing the dateline</strong><br />\n  Heading in a south-westerly direction <em>Silver Explorer</em> will once again have to pass the dateline! This time we gain a day and have the fourth of October twice.<br />\n  On our first fourth of October you can attend lectures about the Cook Island and perhaps the pearl industry, taste some of the culinary specialties prepared by our chefs, or simply relax on the outer decks. Enjoy the wide open space of the South Pacific. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Manihiki, Cook Islands</strong><br />\n  According to many, Manihiki is the most beautiful of the Cook Islands.&nbsp; Known as “The Island of Pearls”, it is a triangular atoll in the Northern Group composed of 40 tiny islets encircling a lagoon four kilometres wide.&nbsp; This completely enclosed body of water is the source of the island’s greatest asset —black pearls. </p>\n<p>At the pier you will be welcomed by representatives of the villages with speeches, prayers and dances. During an excursion across the lagoon you can learn first-hand how the pearls are made by taking an informative pearl farm tour, or use the occasion to swim and/or snorkel over and around the pearl lines. The villagers will have prepared a local lunch and will be available to show and sell you some of their finest pearls.&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Suwarrow, Cook Islands</strong><br />\n  Suwarrow is a coral atoll in the centre of the Cook Islands, roughly 1300km south of the equator. Although its name goes back to a Russian visit in the early 19th century the island is considered Crown Land and as such Queen Elizabeth II is the official owner. The island has a rich history and has had a number of solitary ‘caretakers’.&nbsp; One of them, New Zealander Tom Neale, lived here for a total of 16 years. His experience during his first two periods was written up by him and became a bestseller as “An Island to Oneself”. </p>\n<p>In 1978, the island was declared a National Park of the Cook Islands due to the plentiful marine and bird life it supports. Today the island’s population consists of 2 caretakers (from April to October) and millions of birds. Sooty Terns, Masked Boobies, Red-footed Boobies, Brown Boobies, Great Frigatebirds, and noddies nest on most islets, and the atoll is also an important wintering site for Bristle-thighed Curlews, making this a paradise for our bird-watchers. Humpback whales frequent the waters surrounding Suwarrow and green turtles come into the lagoon using the beaches to deposit their eggs ashore. The atoll’s islets are home to large populations of coconut crabs.</p>\n<p><em>Silver Explorer</em> has received a special permit to visit this outstanding atoll and we intend to make the most of our time ashore and in the water. <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 13 — At sea</strong><br />\n  Today will be a day to scan the seas for humpback whales, especially since the area northwest of Aitutaki is known as an area where they congregate. Our lecture staff will have time to prepare you for our visit to Aitutaki and Atiu, and talk about the natural history, seabirds, and underwater creatures, as well as the early settlers of the Cook Islands and their interesting stories. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 — Aitutaki, Cook Islands</strong><br />\n  Aitutaki is rightly known as one of the most spectacular destinations in the Cook Islands. Its reef completely encompasses a large turquoise lagoon. </p>\n<p>We go ashore using our fleet of Zodiacs -but before stepping on land, a local warrior appears and challenges all visitors. Once we have each stepped across a special stone at the landing site, we are free to do as we please on the island. Our excursion continues aboard local boats, crossing the lagoon to the small islet of Tapuaetai for a delicious barbecue luncheon in a lush South Pacific setting. Look for Red-tailed Tropicbirds, grab some snorkelling gear to see what is underwater at Honeymoon Islet or let your stroll along the beach continue out onto a sand cay.</p>\n<p>Birders will be looking for the Blue Lorikeets among the coconut palm trees in Arutanga. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 15 — Atiu, Cook Islands</strong><br />\n  Atiu is locally referred to as “Enuamanu” –the land of birds- and birders will love the opportunity to look for the Atiu Swiftlet, which not only is endemic to the island, but breeds in only two of Atiu’s caves. Other special birds are the recently introduced Rarotonga Monarch –an endangered species endemic to the Cook Islands- and the Kuhl’s or Rimatara Lori. This bird is only known from a handful of islands, and –if we have not seen it on Christmas Island- would be another highlight for birders.</p>\n<p>We will be welcomed by representatives of Atiu’s five villages, which incidentally are all located at the centre of the island. There will be several options to hike across the island looking for birds, exploring caves and photographing the small secluded beaches of this <em>Makatea-</em>type island. Atiu is also famous for its Arabica coffee and the local bush beer.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 16 —At Sea</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer </em>will sail in a northwesterly direction to reach French Polynesia and the Society Islands. Our lecturers might talk about the different explorations and approaches of the British and French and their overseas colonies of the 19th century, or perhaps about some of the famous writers or painters that made the Pacific their home. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 17 — Raiatea, French Polynesia</strong><br />\n  Raiatea, meaning \"faraway heaven\", is not only famous for its stunningly beautiful bays and landscapes, but also its rich culture and history. The <em>Silver Explorer</em> will anchor in Faaroa Bay and guests can travel by Zodiac up the Faaroa River, the only navigable river in the whole of French Polynesia. Raiatea launched migratory journeys to faraway islands now called Hawaii and New Zealand. </p>\n<p>Our journey takes us alongside dense tropical rainforests with trees that dip gracefully into the water, to a Botanical Garden where we will go ashore with a local guide to learn more about the island’s plant life. </p>\n<p>A scenic driving tour past a vanilla plantation takes us to the dramatic and well maintained Marae Taputapuatea. As Raiatea was considered to be the religious centre of Polynesia, this is a highly significant marae site with many associated legends involving both the sacred and magical. In the afternoon we will make a Zodiac landing on the sandy beaches of tranquil Moto Iriru to swim and snorkel above colourful underwater gardens or drift snorkel through the more challenging Iriru pass. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 18 — Bora Bora, French Polynesia</strong><br />\n  One cannot adequately describe the spectacular beauty of Bora Bora’s emerald-green hills and tranquil sapphire-blue lagoons. Be on deck while we enter through the only pass into the lagoon and drop anchor in front of Vaitape, Bora Bora’s main village.</p>\n<p>Select from a variety of excursions and activities today. Enjoy a leisurely, open-air ‘le truck’ tour of Bora Bora’s highlights: ancient marae stone temples, the Faanui Protestant Church, scenic lookout points with spectacular vistas of the lagoon and distant islands, old WWII remnants and popular Matira Beach. Sample local fruits, watch a pareo demonstration, and stop at Bloody Mary’s before returning to the ship. </p>\n<p>Alternatively, use specially designed, open-air, off-road vehicles, to circle the island and visit some of its most dramatic sites that are only accessible by four-wheel drive. Veer inland following a trail that leads up the mountain to an amazing panorama. From this height, you can view Bora Bora’s breathtaking multi-coloured lagoon. See canons remaining from the American’s presence during WWII. </p>\n<p>Perhaps the most spectacular way to see Bora Bora is from the air on a helicopter flyover. This optional excursion includes 15 minutes of actual flight time aboard a 5-seat “Squirrel” helicopter. Circle the island to enjoy spectacular views of lagoons fringed with white sandy beaches and linked to smaller islets. Fly low over the reef to see rays and sharks skimming through the water. At one point, the aircraft climbs over the velvety green peaks, providing incredible views. </p>\n<p>Of course, you may choose instead to simply spend the day swimming and snorkelling in this idyllic tropical paradise.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 19 —Papeete, French Polynesia</strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia</strong><br />\n  Embark the <em>Silver Explorer</em> and depart on your exciting Silversea Expedition — “In the Wake of the Bounty”. </p>\n<p>Once you have settled in and before <em>Silver Explorer</em> leaves Papeete, you will attend a mandatory safety drill. During a special sail away party look for dolphins or whale that linger near the entrance of the harbour and say good-bye the Society Islands. </p>\n<p>This evening you can enjoy the delights of The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 </strong><strong>— At sea</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Today we will be able to relax after the long voyage to Tahiti. Gather in The Theatre for staff introductions and briefings on Zodiac safety. The members of the Expedition Team are all knowledgeable experts in their various scientific fields. They will present lectures about the rarely visited islands and archipelagoes that we will visit. Topics will include botany, anthropology and ornithology, and prepare you for the adventures to come. As our voyage follows to a certain degree the route of <em>HMS Bounty</em>, our Historian will also describe how our itinerary is connected to the famous breadfruit-expedition of William Bligh and Fletcher Christian.</p>\n<p>The waters surrounding the Austral Islands are a well-known breeding ground for humpback whales, so be sure to have your binoculars when heading out on deck to watch for cetaceans with our Marine Biologist. Other onboard diversions may include photographic workshops, spa treatments, and a workout in the Fitness Centre.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 — Raivavae, Austral Islands, French Polynesia</strong><br />\n  Our first stop in the Austral Islands has been described as a small and laid-back version of Bora Bora –without the tourists. We will land on Raivavae’s north shore to semi-circumnavigate the island by local bus. A stop will be made at a marae where one of the few tiki carved on Raivavae can still be seen in a private garden. Once past the airport –which had to be built in the lagoon because there was not enough flat space on land- we will come to meet our Zodiacs again on the southeast side to be transferred across the lagoon to Motu Vaiamanu. This is the typical South Sea paradise one expects: crystal-clear waters, white sandy beaches, pandanus and coconut palm trees, with reef fish for snorkelers to enjoy and tropicbirds, reef herons, noddies and the occasional shorebird for our birders. If you just want to relax on the beach listen to the local musicians and taste some of the local delicacies prepared for you.<br />\n  At noon we head back to the ship and will continue to sail southwards. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 4-5 — Rapa Iti, Austral Islands, French Polynesia</strong><br />\n  The island of Rapa (or Rapa Iti) is the southernmost inhabited island of French Polynesia. Two villages are located inside what seems to be a volcano’s caldera open to the east. A narrow channel leads into the bay and depending on conditions <em>Silver Explorer</em> might have to drift in front of the entrance.<br />\n  Going ashore by Zodiacs, we will visit the main village of Ahurei, and intend to reach one of the 28 ridgetop fortresses known to exit. The best example is the fortress of Morunga Uta. Excavated in 1956 by William Mulloy from Wyoming and local helpers, this fort -as all the others too- would indicate local warfare by the 16th to 17th century. The climb needs stamina and good weather –the trails are unpaved and tend to be very slippery after rain.</p>\n<p>The two villages today have a combined population of 515 inhabitants and are famous throughout French Polynesia for their religious singing. Apart from a folkloric presentation in Ahurei, we want to attend the local church and hear their singing.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Marotiri, Austral Islands, French Polynesia</strong><br />\n  Some 75 kilometres southeast of Rapa are the four uninhabited rocks that make up the Bass Group, known as Marotiri to the Polynesians. According to stories from Rapa, these rocks were used on occasions to exile unwanted Rapans.</p>\n<p>The rocks are an important breeding site for seabirds and fish are abundant. Pending permission by the French Polynesian authorities we will take our Zodiacs to cruise around the four rocks and look for the seabird colonies on French Polynesia’s most remote possession. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 7-8 — At sea</strong><br />\n  As the <em>Silver Explorer</em> travels from the southern Austral Islands to the equally rarely visited Pitcairn Islands, we will learn about the residents of these remote islands –not only humans, but also plants and animals. Having visited some of the Austral Islands, our lecturers will use the sea days to talk about the Pitcairn Group, seemingly uninhabited islands and their importance to wildlife and the early Polynesian seafarers that not only stopped on the islands for a short while, but actually settled some of them during centuries.</p>\n<p>When not attending a lecture or relaxing on the Sun Deck, get help from the onboard Photographer during a workshop or contemplate the wide expanse of the South Pacific while<em>Silver Explorer </em>will sail in a northwesterly direction to reach the Pitcairn Islands. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Oeno, Pitcairn Islands, UK</strong><br />\n  Located 120 kilometres northwest of Pitcairn, Oeno is a beautiful low-lying island rarely visited. Oeno used to be the island Pitcairners went to on their ‘holidays’. The little island is surrounded by white sandy beaches inside a lagoon. A sand bar, which is constantly undergoing change, is currently unattached to the island. Home to a number of seabirds -such as Murphy's Petrels, Sooty Terns and Brown Noddies- it was necessary to eradicate the rats some twenty years ago. Since this happened the birds have had a higher chance of survival.</p>\n<p>Access to the island is quite limited, as the currents close to the channel leading to the island can be quite strong and one has to carefully navigate around the many coral heads.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 10 — Pitcairn Island, Pitcairn Islands, UK </strong><br />\n  Halfway between Peru and New Zealand, Pitcairn was the perfect hiding spot for the famed HMS <em>Bounty</em> mutineers and their Tahitian wives. Not only had the island been misplaced on early maps of the region, but it can also be very difficult to come ashore as large breakers tend to build up just in front of the small harbour of Bounty Bay. Depending on the sea conditions, we will either go ashore by Zodiac, or will have the privilege to use the Pitcairners’ longboats.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to visit with the islanders, descendants of the <em>Bounty</em> crew, and get a sense of their daily lives, far removed from the rest of the world. Listen to their distinct dialect, a combination of 18th-century English and Tahitian, and explore the island, either on your own or accompanied by one of our experts. We plan to visit the museum, the cemetery, the school and will hike towards Fletcher Christian’s cave. Birders should be on the lookout for the endemic Pitcairn Reed Warbler, while stamp collectors will certainly want to purchase a few of the coveted Pitcairn Island stamps to keep as reminders of their visit to this remote and storied island. Pitcairn Island cook books, hand-carved replicas of the Bounty, walking canes, and other souvenirs will be set up at Adamstown’s meeting ground next to the church and post office. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Henderson, Pitcairn Islands, UK</strong><br />\n  On this remote and uninhabited piece of land – a raised coral island virtually untouched by man – you will get a true sense of how the landscape has appeared for endless years, while gaining an understanding of how natural selection has resulted in Henderson’s primary attraction: four endemic land birds. The onboard Ornithologist will lead a guided nature walk, hoping to spot the flightless Henderson Rail, Stephen’s (or Henderson) Lorikeet, the Henderson Fruit-dove, and the Henderson Reed Warbler. The island is also known to have ten endemic species of plant life. To protect the rare, natural state of Henderson Island, UNESCO designated it as a World Heritage Site in 1988.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Ducie Atoll, Pitcairn Islands, UK</strong><br />\n  Ducie, a small isolated atoll, is the easternmost of the Pitcairn Islands. A mere speck in the surrounding expanse of ocean, uninhabited except for the estimated 500,000 nesting seabirds that reside among the two plant species (Beach Heliotrope and at least one specimen of Pemphis) that grow over seventy percent of the island. Bird species we should be able see include Murphy's Petrels, White Terns, Great Frigatebirds and Masked Boobies. In this rarely visited spot, you can count yourself amongst the few to ever snorkel on top of the wreck of the Acadia or in the atoll’s lagoon waters. Learn about the island’s history, from its discovery to the 1881 wreckage of the <em>Acadia</em>, and hear the latest news regarding recent conservation efforts. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 13-14 — At sea</strong><br />\n  Join our Easter Island expert in The Theatre for his fascinating lecture series about this unique destination in the Pacific and its fascinating history and attend a briefing on the variety of sites that can be visited and other important information needed to make the most of your time ashore. </p>\n<p>Join our Photographer to view the video presentation of our journey so far. On the night before Easter Island the Captain would like to invite you to his Farewell Cocktail Reception and the Restaurant Manager and Executive Chef have prepared a special Farewell Dinner. <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 15 — Easter Island, Chile</strong><br />\n  During the morning Easter Island will gradually appear on the horizon and once we have cleared into Chile –hopefully during lunchtime- we will go ashore using our fleet of Zodiacs. Depending on the wind and currents there are several possible landing sites, but we hope to be able to land at Hangaroa-o-Tai, the very centre of Easter Island’s only village. </p>\n<p>This afternoon we will have an introduction to Easter Island’s archaeological ruins. <br />\n  During the two days we spend at Easter Island, we will visit the Rano Raraku quarry where the massive <em>moai</em> (statues) were carved. At Ahu Tongariki, you will be able to see fifteen moai that were re-erected in the early 1990s. Time permitting; we may also be able to explore the ceremonial village of Orongo, the sacred site of the ancient ‘birdman’ festivities and the restored platforms at Tahai. Lovely Anakena Beach, the island’s largest white sand beach, where according to legend the legendary leader Hotu Matu’a landed, will be part of the excursion.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Easter Island, Chile</strong><br />\n  Embark the <em>Silver Explorer</em> and depart on your exciting Silversea Expedition — “In Search of Robinson Crusoe”. </p>\n<p>Once you have settled in and before <em>Silver Explorer</em> leaves Easter Island, you will attend a mandatory safety drill. Join us for a Sail Away Cocktail on the outer decks as we sail along Easter Island’s impressive cliffs and shore. Later you will be introduced to your Expedition Team. This evening the Restaurant Manager and Executive Chef would like to invite you to the delights of a specially prepared menu in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 </strong><strong>— Isla Salas y Gomez</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Heading in a west-northwesterly direction we will approach Salas y Gomez around noon. This will give you time to unwind after the long flight to Easter Island, have a leisurely breakfast and then join one of our onboard experts for a lecture in The Theatre.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon we will take to our Zodiacs to circumnavigate the island and some of the submerged rocks. In terms of wildlife we can expect to see Christmas Shearwater, Brown Noddies, Masked Boobies, as well as Great Frigatebirds and Sooty Terns –the last two of prime importance to Easter Island’s socio-religious birdman cult. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 3-6 —At sea</strong><br />\n  Having left Salas y Gomez behind, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will have to cover more than 1300 miles to reach the nearest land to the east. </p>\n<p>During our days at sea we will be looking for large schools of dolphins, the occasional seabirds and perhaps some of the humpback whales that have been observed off the coasts of Easter Island and Chile.</p>\n<p>Our lecturers will present talks about Chile, its natural history and obviously topics related to our next destination, the Juan Fernandez Archipelago. Attend workshops and seminars, relax, enjoy the solitude of the open ocean, and sample the culinary specialities prepared by our Executive Chef and his team.<br />\n  &nbsp;<br />\n  <strong>Day 7 —Alexander Selkirk, Juan Fernandez Archipelago, Chile</strong><br />\n  Today we reach one of the most isolated islands of Chile. Formerly called “Más Afuera” -which clearly stated that is was “further away”- it received the name of Alexander Selkirk in 1966 to entice tourism to the archipelago, but not to the island. Alexander Selkirk is only sporadically used by fishermen from Robinson Crusoe to harvest spiny lobster. There is a small group of buildings on the island’s eastern shore, but landing is conditioned by swell.</p>\n<p>We will use the Zodiacs for a cruise along the shore, looking for the feral goats that were left in the archipelago already in the 16th century, and the Juan Fernandez fur seal colonies on the western coast. If possible we will go ashore near one of the colonies. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Robinson Crusoe, Juan Fernandez Archipelago, Chile</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will anchor in Cumberland Bay, not too far from the main settlement and only village of Robinson Crusoe. Formerly called “Mas a Tierra” (closer to land) the island’s name was changed to Robinson Crusoe, Daniel Defoe’s famous literary character, hoping to attract more tourism in 1966. <br />\n  The island has several historical facts that make it interesting: from its discovery by Juan Fernandez, to its use as a provisioning stop for pirates and explorers alike, a penal colony during the Chilean independence movement, its various schemes of exploitation, the connection to World War I, and finally the several tsunamis that have caused the current village to be redesigned for safety.</p>\n<p>We will land at San Juan Bautista in Cumberland Bay to offer several walks and hikes to various lookout points –including Alexander Selkirk’s viewpoint- and to look for the endemic plants and birds that have put Juan Fernandez on the list of UNESCO Biosphere Reserves and the tentative UNESCO World Heritage list. Heading up to the Plazoleta El Yunque (the anvil), we will hike through pine, cypress and eucalyptus forests, but will also be able to see many of the local plants and the Juan Fernandez Firecrown.</p>\n<p>Both hikes to the viewpoints offer different views of Cumberland Bay and the surrounding landscape, but from Selkirk’s lookout you can also see the barren eastern side of Robinson Crusoe with the small island of Santa Clara in the background. </p>\n<p>An easy walk will lead to the cliff where the projectiles shot at the German light cruiser <em>SMS Dresden</em> during WWI can still be seen. During this walk it is normally possible to see the Juan Fernandez fur seals in the water, while hummingbirds might frequent the shrubs and flowers near the cemetery.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — At sea</strong><br />\n  Our last day of the voyage can be used to edit the photos taken, to attend a lecture -perhaps about Valparaiso, its historic centre, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and Chile’s modern history- or visit the Spa and Fitness Centre, you can also relax on the Sun Deck after yesterday’s walks and hikes.</p>\n<p>Do not miss the presentation of the documentary of our voyage by the onboard Videographer.</p>\n<p>In the evening the Captain would like to invite you to the Farewell Cocktail and the Farewell Dinner, <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 10 —Valparaiso, Chile</strong><br />\n  While Silver Explorer approaches Valparaiso, take in the sights of “The Pearl of the Pacific” –as the city is known in Chile’s literature and music. Valparaiso’s historic hillside settlements (including the still used funiculars) have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<br />\n  After breakfast disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Valparaiso, Chile</strong><br />\n  Embark the <em>Silver Explorer</em> and depart on your exciting Silversea Expedition — “Chilean Fjords”. <br />\nOnce you have settled in and before <em>Silver Explorer</em> leaves Valparaiso, you will attend a mandatory safety drill. During a special sail away party take in the sights of “The Pearl of the Pacific” –as the city is known in Chile’s literature and music. Valparaiso’s historic hillside settlements (including the still used funiculars) have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Later you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and this evening you can enjoy the delights of a specially prepared menu in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — At Sea, cruising the Humboldt Current </strong><br />\nTake the first morning to unwind after your travels to join <em>Silver Explorer</em> in Valparaiso. Our experts will present talks in The Theatre to give you an introduction to Chile and the region’s wildlife and nature. Today our lecturers will introduce you to the natural and historical highlights of Valdivia and Chile’s Lake District. </p>\n<p>Due to the presence of the very nutrient-rich Humboldt Current, the waters along the Chilean coast are rich in fish life. Today our chefs might introduce you to the world of “ceviche” in its many forms.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 — Niebla, Chile</strong><br />\nDuring the early morning <em>Silver Explorer</em> will anchor in the Corral Bay halfway between Corral and Niebla. Niebla is a small village on the banks of the Rio Valdivia where Chile’s Corral Bay meets the Pacific Ocean. Today Niebla is a beach resort, but in 1671 it was a defensive fortress built by Spanish conquerors to prevent attacks from pirates and corsairs. </p>\n<p>This morning you can either drive to the charming river port city of Valdivia, where we will find an interesting blend of influences from the native Mapuche, Spanish settlers, and German immigrants, or take a catamaran on the river. In both cases you will have time to see the town of Valdivia. The first German colonists arrived here in 1849 and worked hard to develop Valdivia into one of southern Chile’s most productive areas and their influence can be felt in every corner of this city. The town was affected by the 1960 earthquake –the worst ever recorded- but rebuilt with a strong German imprint. On our way to Valdivia we can see tracts of land that are still under water as a result of the quake. We will visit the river market and have a look at downtown Valdivia with its mix of old and modern buildings. You will have to choose whether you would like to visit the Fort at Niebla or enjoy fresh fish and crabs in Valdivia.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon <em>Silver Explorer</em> will head south, giving our lecturers time to expand on the natural history of Chile’s Lake Region. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Puerto Montt, Chile</strong><br />\nPuerto Montt is the starting point for our excursions to the Lake District and specifically Lago Llanquihue.</p>\n<p>We will drive along the southern shore of Chile’s second-largest lake and head for the Petrohué waterfalls. These falls ‘connect’ Lago Esmeralda with Lago Llanquihue and we will walk over to the viewing platforms of Chile’s best-known falls. Here we will have an opportunity to see some of the local plants and endemic trees. Later you will have the choice to either visit a typical Chilean farm to learn about the traditions of southern Chile’s food, music, tools and the national sport of rodeo –which is quite different from the North American version- or to have lunch at a local restaurant and to explore the town of Puerto Varas.<br />\n  If you choose the Fundo Olguita, you will have lunch including empanadas, a tasty barbeque und traditional German desserts –this area was first colonized by Germans in the mid-19th century. You will also have the chance to learn the Chilean national dance, the Cueca.</p>\n<p>If you choose Puerto Varas, you will have time to explore the “City of Roses” –as Puerto Varas is known- and to browse the small handicraft village and see some of the wooden buildings for which the town was declared a “Heritage Zone”.</p>\n<p>After these excursions take your time to join the bar team for a Pisco Sour evening. Learn more about this iconic drink and why this is both Peru’s and Chile’s national drink.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Castro, Chile</strong><br />\n  Chiloé Island is home to an amazing collection of 150 Jesuit-built wooden churches, houses raised up on poles out of the water, and more than 400 native plant varieties. <br />\n  From Castro, we head north to the picturesque village of Dalcahue and a brief ferry ride to the island of Quinchao, passing through Curaco de Velez. This tiny village of approximately 500 inhabitants had its best times around 1850. Today, beautiful houses remain as a testament to those earlier days. Black-necked Swans can sometimes be seen near the here. We then head for Achao, which was founded by the Jesuits in 1743. Achao is a lively town with boats arriving every day from all the surrounding islands.<br />\n  We will visit the Jesuit’s Achao Church, the oldest wooden structure in Chiloé and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Constructed in 1730, it contains beautiful baroque imagery. Afterwards, we cross Achao’s main square to enjoy a snack and typical local music before returning to Dalcahue. Here we will visit the well-preserved Dalcahue Church with its galvanized iron roof. The details and precision of the imagery carved by Jesuits from locally grown Patagonian cypress, larch and luma trees, are amazing. It was declared a World Heritage site in 2000.<br />\n  Alternatively, visit three of the 16 UNESCO World Heritage Site churches on the island of Chiloé in Vilupulli, Chonchi and Castro. Apart from the churches, the Museum of Traditions will be visited in Chonchi. This small museum houses artefacts and photos relating to Chiloe and Chonchi and recreates the feeling of Chonchi in the early 20th century. The excursion ends with a visit to Castro’s handicraft market.<br />\nIn the afternoon <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail along the eastern shore of Chiloe towards the Guaitecas Archipelago. Spend time on deck looking for Chilean dolphins and Peale’s dolphins –the Guaitecas are considered a hot spot for them.&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — At Sea </strong><br />\nToday <em>Silver Explorer</em> will venture again into the Pacific and will round the Taitao and Tres Montes Peninsulas before entering the Golfo de Penas –where the sea tends to be rough, but the area is known for its whales and dolphins sightings.</p>\n<p>Watch for cetaceans or relax in one of the lounges with that book you’ve been meaning to read and meet up with new friends for cocktails. In the evening, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will enter the Messier Channel and will from then on continue Chile’s Inside Passage –and calm waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Cruise English Narrows and Pio XI Glacier, Chile</strong><br />\n  Very early his morning this morning –actually before sunrise- we head towards the English Narrows. Our Captain and the local Chilean Pilots expertly manoeuvre <em>Silver Explorer</em> through the slalom course of islands and channel markers. At the narrowest part it has a width of 80 metres, permitting the passage of only one vessel at a time. <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  Once we have passed the English Narrows you will have time for a leisurely breakfast and to attend lectures about the Fjords’ natural history or perhaps a seminar. The whole region of the fjords is so inhospitable that only one single settlement exists south of the English Narrows –Puerto Eden.<br />\nBirders will want to see what species want to live in this area. The further south we head the better the chance to see Andean Condors majestically soaring above the hills and mountains. </p>\n<p>In the afternoon we will visit the Pio XI Glacier. This tidewater glacier sprawled out in front of us is 4.5 km wide and a remarkable shade of brilliant blue. An outlet glacier of the South Patagonian Ice Field, the Pio XI had once extended out into the fjords whose waters we ply today. Conditions permitting, we will board our Zodiacs and dodge brash ice and bergy bits as we approach the glacier at a safe distance. Alert for signs of calving, we may see chunks of ice falling from the glacier front. <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 8 — Cruise White Narrows and Puerto Natales, Chile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  Today <em>Silver Explorer</em> will reach the White Narrows and another spectacular facet of the vast expenses of the Chilean Fjords. On approach through Chile’s largest national park, Bernardo O’Higgins, the famous White Narrows become evident as mountains loom in on both sides of the fjord with hardy native plants clinging to barren rock. With only approximately 80 meters (260 feet) of clearance from either side of the passage, the sharp turns of the ship, skillfully executed between rocky outcrops, are fascinating to watch from the outer decks. On the transit through the breathtaking White Narrows, it is also possible to see seals and dolphins plying the waters alongside the ship.<br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will be in front of Puerto Natales at about dinner time. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Puerto Natales, Chile</strong><br />\nFrom Puerto Natales we will head out to Torres del Paine National Park by bus. This is considered by many to be the most spectacular worldwide Reserve at the end of the world. Covering an area of 242,000 hectares, the park is a fertile combination of lakes, lagoons, waterfalls, glaciers, hills and spectacular peaks and is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. On the way to Laguna Sarmiento, the entrance to the park, we will stop for photos of the free roaming guanacos, Andean Condors and other wildlife. There will be opportunities to see the Salto Grande waterfall, the famous Torres del Paine peaks (weather permitting) and Nordenskjold Lake. Lunch will be had at the Serrano River area. Within the park there will be three different options of walks and hikes –depending on your fitness or willingness to exercise.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Puerto Natales, White Narrows and Montañas Fjord, Chile</strong><br />\n  Leaving Puerto Natales in the morning, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will once again have to pass White Narrows. This will give us another chance to spot wildlife and marvel at the amount of work and time that went into charting these waters.<br />\nIn the afternoon, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will enter the narrow Canal de las Montañas and will sail parallel to the Cordillera de Sarmiento. Several cascades and seven glaciers come down the steep sides of the mountains and –conditions permitting- we might do a Zodiac cruise or even land for a short hike. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Cruise the Chilean Fjords, Chile</strong><br />\nOur course will take us through the vast expense of the Chilean Fjords. We will sail through Chile’s largest national park, Bernardo O’Higgins, before we head for another famous narrow channel, the western portion of the Strait of Magellan. Mountains loom on both sides of the ship and <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail through the Francisco Coloane Marine Park, an area humpback whales are known to frequent.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 —Alberto de Agostini National Park and Ainsworth Bay, Chile</strong><br />\nToday <em>Silver Explorer</em> will navigate past Dawson Island –quite infamous in Chile’s modern-day history as a penal settlement for political prisoners- into Almirantazgo Sound, to arrive at Ainsworth Bay. The bay is within Alberto De Agostini National Park, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Depending on conditions, we intend to offer a Zodiac cruise to see the Marinelli Glacier descending from Darwin Mountain Range. This area will give a good appreciation how the land returns to life after glacial retreat. We also intend to take a walk in the stunning sub-polar Magellanic forest teeming with evergreens and deciduous trees. The bay promises a good chance of sighting Southern elephant seals, while nearby Tucker Island is known to have Magellanic Penguins.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 —Punta Arenas, Chile</strong><br />\nFrom the capital of the region we will drive to an estancia that was founded by French-Irish immigrants in the early 20th century. Through presentations of sheep herding, sheep shearing and a special demonstration of rodeo techniques (Chilean-style –very much unlike North American rodeos) you will get a glimpse of what life on a Patagonian estancia is. A Pisco Sour, an empanada and a typical Patagonian BBQ lunch will emphasize and highlight this country life.</p>\n<p>On the drive to and from the estancia, many photo opportunities will be had to see guanacos, Andean Condors and other wildlife. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 —Cruise Garibaldi Fjord and Glacier, Chile</strong><br />\n<em>Silver Explorer </em>will again sail out into the Pacific Ocean to reach the Beagle Channel, heading for Garibaldi Fjord. This beautiful corner of the Chilean fjords still lies within the Alberto de Agostini National Park, Chile’s third largest national park. This park - with its 14.600 km2 - includes all Chilean islands south of the Magellan Strait, including a portion of Tierra del Fuego.</p>\n<p>The Garibaldi is an impressive glacier on the south face of the Cordillera Darwin. During a Zodiac cruise we will see the different shades of blue of the ice -and calving events can make for a very impressive sight. Dozens of waterfalls dot the cliffs and in some cases the wind gusts can be so strong that the water gets blown upwards!</p>\n<p>In terms of wildlife we can expect the majestic Andean Condor, a South American sea lion colony, skuas, kingfishers, Flightless Steamer Ducks, Crested Ducks, Kelp Geese, Ashy-headed Geese, caracaras, vultures, and nesting Imperial Shags among others.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 15 —Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\n  After breakfast disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Ushuaia, Argentina </strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Explorer</em> and meet some of your fellow explorers as you become acquainted with the luxurious amenities found on board. A mandatory safety drill will take place before you set sail. During the afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and important members of the crew. At sail-away enjoy the mountain-lined shoreline of the Beagle Channel while you leave Ushuaia and bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego, the Land at the End of the World. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  The Expedition Team’s expert lecturers will present ornithological and historical insights into the Falkland Islands, our first destination. You might hear about the early European explorers and the different attempts at settling the Falkland Islands/Malvinas. Get introduced to the specific birdlife we expect to see during our stay by our onboard Ornithologist.</p>\n<p>Tonight, you are invited to attend a special Welcome Aboard cocktail party hosted by the Captain, who will introduce his senior officers.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 —&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; West Point Island and Saunders Island, Falkland Islands</strong><br />\n  Watch for Peale’s dolphins and the distinctive black and white markings of the Commerson’s dolphin as <em>Silver Explorer</em> approaches West Point Island in the remote Falkland Islands/Malvinas. Walk across rolling moorland to reach colonies of Black-browed Albatrosses that nest side-by-side with Rockhopper Penguins. Learn about the island’s unique vegetation. The hospitable island owners are always happy to answer your questions and share their stories.</p>\n<p>During lunch <em>Silver Explorer</em> will reposition to Saunders Island, the second-largest of the offshore islands. Apart from its historical importance –this is where the first British settlement was located- Saunders’ wildlife is quite varied. Depending on the weather conditions we will attempt a landing at the Neck, to see several penguin species, as well as other seabirds and land birds. Gentoo Penguins and King Penguins reside in the open dune and sand flat area, while Rockhopper Penguins, Imperial Shags and Black-browed Albatrosses frequent Mount Richards. Other key bird species are the Black–throated Finch, Ruddy-headed Goose and Falkland Steamer Duck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Stanley, Falkland Islands </strong><br />\n  Stanley is the capital of the remote Falkland Islands, and has a distinct British ambience. </p>\n<p>You can join a classic ‘City Highlights’ tour which covers Stanley and surrounding environs. This excursion passes by older and newer portions of Stanley, stopping at the local harbor for small boats, both in current operations as well as half sunken hulks from 100 years ago -some of which are now being used as docks. Additional stops will be the shipwreck of the <em>Lady Elizabeth</em>, the peat cutting area, an outdoor whale bone display, war memorials and the museum.</p>\n<p>Stroll through the charming streets of this colourful little town, lined with quaint cottages and a variety of traditional pubs, and visit the 19th-century Anglican cathedral. Some lingering reminders of the 1982 Falklands War between Britain and Argentina may still be seen though the island has settled back to its quiet business of raising sheep.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 5–6 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Binoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to watch for seabirds and marine mammals. Gather in The Theatre to perhaps hear about Captain Cook’s first visit to South Georgia or to learn about the region’s endemic wildlife and remarkable nature. Our knowledgeable onboard experts will present lectures and seminars in a variety of scientific fields. Other onboard diversions may include photography workshops, spa treatments, a workout in the Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Days 7–9 — South Georgia </strong><br />\n  This breathtaking destination of towering snow-covered mountains, mighty glaciers, and low-lying grasslands attracts an astounding concentration of wildlife: Southern fur seals, southern elephant seals and a variety of albatross species including Black-browed, Light-mantled Sooty, Grey-headed and the spectacular Wandering Albatross, plus thousands of King and Macaroni Penguins.</p>\n<p>South Georgia is also linked to the early Antarctic explorers. Captain James Cook first stepped ashore in 1775, but perhaps more famous is Ernest Shackleton’s arrival in 1916 following the sinking of his ship <em>Endurance</em>. Visit the graves of Shackleton and Frank Wild, and the whaling museum at Grytviken. Here are some of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Cooper’s Bay </strong><br />\n  -Enjoy a Zodiac cruise to see Macaroni and Chinstrap Penguins on the rocks and in the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Gold Harbour</strong><br />\n  -A large King Penguin colony can be found near Bertrab Glacier.<br />\n  -Seals can be seen sunning on the beaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Grytviken</strong><br />\n  -Grytviken is a historic whaling station. You can still see the remains of the activity, including rusted hulls of long abandoned whaling and sealing ships, and some of the working-areas. <br />\n  -In the museum guests can learn about past whaling techniques and view various exhibits on exploration and discovery.<br />\n  -At the burial site of famous explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton we will toast the great explorer and his many accomplishments. The remains of his faithful companion Frank Wild have been brought here too.</p>\n<p><strong>Salisbury Plain</strong><br />\n  -Salisbury Plain is a favourite breeding ground for hundreds of thousands of King Penguins. It is amazing to see how they completely cover the beaches and hills.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 10–11 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Participate in onboard activities, listen to some of the lectures given, relax in one of the lounges, or peruse an array of titles and topics in the well-stocked Library. Take a stroll on deck and enjoy the solitude and splendour of the vast sea and sky. During the cruise towards the Antarctic Peninsula we might see some of the giant tabular icebergs coming from the Weddell Sea. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands </strong><br />\n  Awesome glaciers greet us as we approach Elephant Island – so named for its former abundance of elephant seals. In 1916, when Ernest Shackleton’s ship <em>Endurance</em> was crushed in pack ice in the Weddell Sea, the crew was stranded here for 137 days. Elephant Island is home to several Chinstrap Penguin rookeries, as well as old moss colonies. Weddell seals and Macaroni Penguins can also be found on the spit of land Shackleton’s men named Point Wild. A solitary statue can be seen there, honouring the Chilean pilot Luis Pardo, who took the cutter <em>Yelcho</em> across the Drake Passage to rescue Shackleton’s men.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 13–16 — Antarctic Peninsula </strong><br />\n  While sailing along the Antarctic Peninsula’ white wilderness, every turn can reveal a new and breathtaking adventure. Remote and otherworldly, Antarctica is irresistible for its spectacular icebergs and calving glaciers, and for the possibility of up-close encounters with marine mammals. Watch for seals sunbathing on slow-moving ice floes and for humpback, Minke, and orca whales to surface from below the frigid waters. Each day we will attempt Zodiac departures, and, if conditions permit, we will cruise amidst colourful icebergs or step ashore to visit a variety of penguin rookeries and perhaps scientific research stations led by our team of natural history experts.</p>\n<p>A flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of favourable sea and weather conditions. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter. Here are some of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Brown Bluff, Tabarin Peninsula</strong> (mainland Antarctica)<br />\n  -Brown Bluff is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock. <br />\n  -Adelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels use this as a breeding area. <br />\n  -As you explore the area, a Weddell seal may be seen basking in the sunlight.<br />\n  -Wait long enough and you might see the Adelie Penguins standing along the shore, finally making their way into the surf. </p>\n<p><strong>Cuverville Island, Errera Channel</strong><br />\n  -Large, bare rock areas provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins. <br />\n  -Snow Petrels and Cape Petrels may be seen, and Wilson’s Storm Petrels nest in the higher scree of the island.<br />\n  -During Zodiac tours, we hope to see hauled-out Weddell and leopard seals<br />\n  -Conditions permitting, we will attempt to hike to the top of the island for some spectacular panoramic views</p>\n<p><strong>Paradise Bay</strong> (Antarctic Peninsula)<br />\n  -The bay is well named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs.<br />\n  -From the ship, observe Argentina’s “Base Almirante Brown”, one of many Antarctic research stations.<br />\n  -View the wildlife from sea level while cruising in our Zodiacs. There is a good chance you will come across a crabeater seal relaxing on a nearby ice floe. Blue-eyed Shags nest in the cliffs close to Almirante Brown, while Brown Skuas like to be around the Base. Minke whales frequent the area.</p>\n<p><strong>Port Lockroy, Goudier Island</strong><br />\n  -The British built a listening station here during WWII, which was then used as a research station in the 1950s and since 1996 as a museum and gift shop.<br />\n  -Snowy Sheathbills and Gentoo Penguins nest and roam outside the museum.<br />\n  -Because of the penguin colony leopard seals are quite often found in the vicinity. </p>\n<p><strong>Paulet Island</strong><br />\n  -The island is home to 80-90 thousand Adelies that come here to breed.<br />\n  -Kelp Gulls and Snowy Sheathbills are amongst the birds that breed on Paulet Island as well as a massive colony of Blue-eyed Shags. <br />\n  -The crew of Otto Nordenskjold’s relief ship <em>Antarctica</em> had to over-winter on the island in 1903. Remnants of their hut still remain.</p>\n<p><strong>Port Foster, Whalers Bay</strong> <strong>(Deception Island)</strong><br />\n  -Deception Island is an excellent example of a caldera where it is believed that the volcano’s summit collapsed with one section sinking far enough to allow the sea to flood the interior. We plan to sail inside this breached wall through a narrow entrance called Neptune’s Bellows.&nbsp; <br />\n  -Our resident Geologist will take the opportunity to explain the unique volcanic features of the area, while our Historian might introduce you to the whaling history of Deception Island. <br />\n  -The British base’s Biscoe House was destroyed by a mudflow after a volcanic eruption in the late 1960s but can still clearly be seen.<br />\n  -Depending on weather conditions several hikes to viewpoints might be offered.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 17–18 — Drake Passage </strong><br />\n  The Drake Passage has a notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to strong westerly winds and the currents pushed through the ‘narrow’ gap between South American and the Antarctic Peninsula. Spend some time on deck watching the horizon and the variety of seabirds that glide in the air currents of our ship’s wake such as the Black-browed Albatross, Sooty Shearwaters, and White-chinned Petrels. Take this opportunity to attend additional presentations offered by the Expedition Team lecturers and to swap photos with new friends as we travel towards Ushuaia.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 19 — Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice conditions. Expedition Team members scheduled for this voyage are subject to change or cancellation.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>GEAR UP</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not sure what to wear while onboard? <a style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #000; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://www.shiptoshoretraveler.com/silversea\">Visit our shop and gear up</a>.

Depending on the weather conditions we will attempt a landing at the Neck, to see several penguin species, as well as other seabirds and land birds. Gentoo Penguins and King Penguins reside in the open dune and sand flat area, while Rockhopper Penguins, Imperial Shags and Black-browed Albatrosses frequent Mount Richards. Other key bird species are the Black–throated Finch, Ruddy-headed Goose and Falkland Steamer Duck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Stanley, Falkland Islands </strong><br />\n  Stanley is the capital of the remote Falkland Islands, and has a distinct British ambience. </p>\n<p>You can join a classic ‘City Highlights’ tour which covers Stanley and surrounding environs. This excursion passes by older and newer portions of Stanley, stopping at the local harbor for small boats, both in current operations as well as half sunken hulks from 100 years ago -some of which are now being used as docks. Additional stops will be the shipwreck of the <em>Lady Elizabeth</em>, the peat cutting area, an outdoor whale bone display, war memorials and the museum.</p>\n<p>Stroll through the charming streets of this colourful little town, lined with quaint cottages and a variety of traditional pubs, and visit the 19th-century Anglican cathedral. Some lingering reminders of the 1982 Falklands War between Britain and Argentina may still be seen though the island has settled back to its quiet business of raising sheep.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 5–6 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Binoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to watch for seabirds and marine mammals. Gather in The Theatre to perhaps hear about Captain Cook’s first visit to South Georgia or to learn about the region’s endemic wildlife and remarkable nature. Our knowledgeable onboard experts will present lectures and seminars in a variety of scientific fields. Other onboard diversions may include photography workshops, spa treatments, a workout in the Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Days 7–9 — South Georgia </strong><br />\n  This breathtaking destination of towering snow-covered mountains, mighty glaciers, and low-lying grasslands attracts an astounding concentration of wildlife: Southern fur seals, southern elephant seals and a variety of albatross species including Black-browed, Light-mantled Sooty, Grey-headed and the spectacular Wandering Albatross, plus thousands of King and Macaroni Penguins.</p>\n<p>South Georgia is also linked to the early Antarctic explorers. Captain James Cook first stepped ashore in 1775, but perhaps more famous is Ernest Shackleton’s arrival in 1916 following the sinking of his ship <em>Endurance</em>. Visit the graves of Shackleton and Frank Wild, and the whaling museum at Grytviken. Here are some of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Cooper’s Bay </strong><br />\n  -Enjoy a Zodiac cruise to see Macaroni and Chinstrap Penguins on the rocks and in the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Gold Harbour</strong><br />\n  -A large King Penguin colony can be found near Bertrab Glacier.<br />\n  -Seals can be seen sunning on the beaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Grytviken</strong><br />\n  -Grytviken is a historic whaling station. You can still see the remains of the activity, including rusted hulls of long abandoned whaling and sealing ships, and some of the working-areas. <br />\n  -In the museum guests can learn about past whaling techniques and view various exhibits on exploration and discovery.<br />\n  -At the burial site of famous explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton we will toast the great explorer and his many accomplishments. The remains of his faithful companion Frank Wild have been brought here too.</p>\n<p><strong>Salisbury Plain</strong><br />\n  -Salisbury Plain is a favourite breeding ground for hundreds of thousands of King Penguins. It is amazing to see how they completely cover the beaches and hills.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 10–11 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Participate in onboard activities, listen to some of the lectures given, relax in one of the lounges, or peruse an array of titles and topics in the well-stocked Library. Take a stroll on deck and enjoy the solitude and splendour of the vast sea and sky. During the cruise towards the Antarctic Peninsula we might see some of the giant tabular icebergs coming from the Weddell Sea. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands </strong><br />\n  Awesome glaciers greet us as we approach Elephant Island – so named for its former abundance of elephant seals. In 1916, when Ernest Shackleton’s ship <em>Endurance</em> was crushed in pack ice in the Weddell Sea, the crew was stranded here for 137 days. Elephant Island is home to several Chinstrap Penguin rookeries, as well as old moss colonies. Weddell seals and Macaroni Penguins can also be found on the spit of land Shackleton’s men named Point Wild. A solitary statue can be seen there, honouring the Chilean pilot Luis Pardo, who took the cutter <em>Yelcho</em> across the Drake Passage to rescue Shackleton’s men.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 13–16 — Antarctic Peninsula </strong><br />\n  While sailing along the Antarctic Peninsula’ white wilderness, every turn can reveal a new and breathtaking adventure. Remote and otherworldly, Antarctica is irresistible for its spectacular icebergs and calving glaciers, and for the possibility of up-close encounters with marine mammals. Watch for seals sunbathing on slow-moving ice floes and for humpback, Minke, and orca whales to surface from below the frigid waters. Each day we will attempt Zodiac departures, and, if conditions permit, we will cruise amidst colourful icebergs or step ashore to visit a variety of penguin rookeries and perhaps scientific research stations led by our team of natural history experts.</p>\n<p>Having spent Christmas in South Georgia, we will have New Year’s Eve and New Year in this spectacular wilderness- surely events that you will not forget. A flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of favourable sea and weather conditions. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter. Here are some of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Brown Bluff, Tabarin Peninsula</strong> (mainland Antarctica)<br />\n  -Brown Bluff is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock. <br />\n  -Adelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels use this as a breeding area. <br />\n  -As you explore the area, a Weddell seal may be seen basking in the sunlight.<br />\n  -Wait long enough and you might see the Adelie Penguins standing along the shore, finally making their way into the surf. </p>\n<p><strong>Cuverville Island, Errera Channel</strong><br />\n  -Large, bare rock areas provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins. <br />\n  -Snow Petrels and Cape Petrels may be seen, and Wilson’s Storm Petrels nest in the higher scree of the island.<br />\n  -During Zodiac tours, we hope to see hauled-out Weddell and leopard seals<br />\n  -Conditions permitting, we will attempt to hike to the top of the island for some spectacular panoramic views</p>\n<p><strong>Paradise Bay</strong> (Antarctic Peninsula)<br />\n  -The bay is well named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs.<br />\n  -From the ship, observe Argentina’s “Base Almirante Brown”, one of many Antarctic research stations.<br />\n  -View the wildlife from sea level while cruising in our Zodiacs. There is a good chance you will come across a crabeater seal relaxing on a nearby ice floe. Blue-eyed Shags nest in the cliffs close to Almirante Brown, while Brown Skuas like to be around the Base. Minke whales frequent the area.</p>\n<p><strong>Port Lockroy, Goudier Island</strong><br />\n  -The British built a listening station here during WWII, which was then used as a research station in the 1950s and since 1996 as a museum and gift shop.<br />\n  -Snowy Sheathbills and Gentoo Penguins nest and roam outside the museum.<br />\n  -Because of the penguin colony leopard seals are quite often found in the vicinity. </p>\n<p><strong>Paulet Island</strong><br />\n  -The island is home to 80-90 thousand Adelies that come here to breed.<br />\n  -Kelp Gulls and Snowy Sheathbills are amongst the birds that breed on Paulet Island as well as a massive colony of Blue-eyed Shags. <br />\n  -The crew of Otto Nordenskjold’s relief ship <em>Antarctica</em> had to over-winter on the island in 1903. Remnants of their hut still remain.</p>\n<p><strong>Port Foster, Whalers Bay</strong> <strong>(Deception Island)</strong><br />\n  -Deception Island is an excellent example of a caldera where it is believed that the volcano’s summit collapsed with one section sinking far enough to allow the sea to flood the interior. We plan to sail inside this breached wall through a narrow entrance called Neptune’s Bellows.&nbsp; <br />\n  -Our resident Geologist will take the opportunity to explain the unique volcanic features of the area, while our Historian might introduce you to the whaling history of Deception Island. <br />\n  -The British base’s Biscoe House was destroyed by a mudflow after a volcanic eruption in the late 1960s but can still clearly be seen.<br />\n  -Depending on weather conditions several hikes to viewpoints might be offered.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 17–18 — Drake Passage </strong><br />\n  The Drake Passage has a notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to strong westerly winds and the currents pushed through the ‘narrow’ gap between South American and the Antarctic Peninsula. Spend some time on deck watching the horizon and the variety of seabirds that glide in the air currents of our ship’s wake such as the Black-browed Albatross, Sooty Shearwaters, and White-chinned Petrels. Take this opportunity to attend additional presentations offered by the Expedition Team lecturers and to swap photos with new friends as we travel towards Ushuaia.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 19 — Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice conditions.

Depending on weather and ice conditions <em>Silver Explorer</em> might visit Brown Bluff, Hope Bay and cruise the  Antarctic Sound.<br />\n  <strong>Brown Bluff,</strong> (a 2,200-foot bluff on the Antarctic continent) is an  ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of  reddish-brown volcanic rock. The coastal area at the base of Brown Bluff is  used by Adelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels as a breeding  area. Under good climatic conditions a walk onto a nearby glacier might be  feasible.<br />\n  <strong>Hope Bay</strong> has one of the  largest Adelie Penguin colonies in Antarctica and a Zodiac cruise past the  Argentine Station “Esperanza” will show some of the penguins, Weddell seals and  Blue-eyed Shags.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 14–15 — Antarctic Peninsula</strong><br />\n  While sailing along the Antarctic Peninsula’ white  wilderness, every turn can reveal a new and breathtaking adventure.

Petermann has various geological  features, especially rock surfaces showing glacial polish and some glacial  grooving. To reach Petermann Island the <strong>Lemaire  Channel</strong> has to be crossed. This is one of the most spectacular channels  with steep snow-covered mountains on both sides and icebergs of different sizes  at the southern end.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 16 — South Shetland Islands </strong><br />\n  The South Shetland Islands run parallel to the  Antarctic Peninsula and have both scientific stations and large penguin  colonies.

Spend some  time on deck watching the horizon and the variety of seabirds that glide in the  air currents of our ship’s wake such as the Black-browed Albatross, Sooty  Shearwaters and White-chinned Petrels. Have your camera ready to capture the  magical colour of late night sunsets. <br />\n  <br />\n  As  we sail on our initial transit, familiarise yourself with the elegant <em>Silver Explorer</em> and the Expedition Team  members. Attend wildlife,  geography and history discussions hosted by our expert naturalists and guest  lecturers that will prepare you for the exciting adventures that lie ahead. When available, visit the Bridge and  meet our Captain and officers; information will be posted in the “Chronicle”,  our daily onboard newsletter.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 4–10 —  Antarctic Peninsula </strong><br />\n  While  sailing in Antarctica, every turn can reveal a new and breathtaking adventure.  Sailing as far south as possible the pack ice becomes thicker and thicker as we  move into Antarctica’s vast white wilderness. Remote and otherworldly,  Antarctica is irresistible for its spectacular icebergs and calving glaciers,  and for the possibility of up-close encounters with marine mammals. Watch for  seals sunbathing ashore and on slow-moving ice floes and for humpback, Minke, and  orca whales to surface. <br />\n  Each  day we will attempt Zodiac departures, and, if conditions permit, we will  cruise amidst colourful icebergs or step ashore to visit a variety of penguin  rookeries and perhaps scientific research stations led by our team of natural  history experts.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Antarctic  Sound </strong><br />\n  We  will start our Antarctic experiences at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula, venturing  into Antarctic Sound and its magnificent array of tabular icebergs, historical  sites and Adelie and Gentoo Penguin rookeries. Depending on weather and ice  conditions <em>Silver Explorer</em> might  visit Brown Bluff, Hope Bay, and Paulet Island and cruise the Antarctic Sound.<br />\n  <strong>Brown Bluff,</strong> (a  2,200-foot bluff on the Antarctic continent) is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high,  flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock. The  coastal area at the base of Brown Bluff is used by Adelie and Gentoo Penguins,  Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels as a breeding area. Under good climatic conditions  a walk onto a nearby glacier might be feasible.<br />\n  <strong>Hope Bay</strong> has one  of the largest Adelie Penguin colonies in Antarctica and a Zodiac cruise past  the Argentine Station “Esperanza” will show some of the penguins, Weddell seals  and Blue-eyed Shags.<strong> Paulet Island</strong> is home to Adelie Penguins, Kelp Gulls and Snowy Sheathbill as well as a  massive colony of Blue-eyed Shags. The crew of Otto Nordenskjold’s relief ship <em>Antarctica</em> had to over-winter on the  island in 1903. Remnants of their hut still remain.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Days 5–9 —  Antarctic Peninsula </strong><br />\n  A  flexible itinerary will allow us to take advantage of favourable sea and  weather conditions. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the  Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on  weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter. Apart from attempting to  cross the Antarctic Circle here are some of the places we may visit:<br />\n  <strong>Cuverville Island,  Errera Channel -</strong>Cuverville’s large bare rock areas provide nesting  sites for Gentoo Penguins. Snow Petrels and Cape Petrels may also be seen  whilst Wilson’s Storm Petrels nest in the higher scree of the island.<strong> </strong>Conditions permitting we will climb part  of the hill for spectacular panoramic views. During Zodiac tours around the  many icebergs, hauled-out Weddell seals may be seen. <strong></strong><br />\n  <strong>Paradise Bay</strong> -The  bay is well named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and  icebergs. From the ship or Zodiac, observe Argentina’s “Base Brown”, one of  many Antarctic research stations.<br />\n  View  the wildlife from sea level while cruising by Zodiac. There’s a good chance you  will come across a crabeater seal relaxing on an ice floe or locate Minke  whales in the bay.<br />\n  <strong>Lemaire Channel</strong>. To  reach Petermann Island and going further south the Lemaire Channel has to be  crossed. This is one of the most spectacular channels with steep snow-covered  mountains on both sides and icebergs of different sizes at the southern end.<br />\n  <strong>Petermann Island,  Wilhelm Archipelago -</strong>The island is named for German geographer  August Petermann and was first discovered by a German expedition in 1873-74. Rock  surfaces show glacial polish, some glacial grooving and nice samples of frost  shattering. During our landing, we will be able to observe rookeries of Adelie  Penguins, Gentoo Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags. <strong></strong><br />\n  <strong>Pleneau Island,  Wilhelm Archipelago -</strong>Pleneau Island lies at the south end of the  Lemaire Channel, and was first explored during Charcot’s 1903–05 French  Antarctic Expedition. The island was named for the expedition’s photographer,  Paul Pleneau.<strong> </strong>Amongst the common  breeding birds are Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls and South Polar Skuas.<strong> </strong>Southern elephant seals are often  hauled-out in wallows. Enjoy spectacular glacial and ice scenery from the  island during a Zodiac cruise in Pleneau Bay.<br />\n  <strong>Attempting the  Antarctic Circle crossing</strong> –On our way south we pass Vernadsky, the  former British Faraday Station, and will see how far we can sail based on the  ice conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — South  Shetland Islands </strong><br />\n  The  South Shetland Islands run parallel to the Antarctic Peninsula and were the  first part of Antarctica seen during the early 19th century, although claims  exist that early European explorers might have been there some 200 years  before. <br />\n  <strong>Aitcho Islands -</strong>As you  step off the Zodiac to explore the island you will be greeted by Gentoo and  Chinstrap Penguins. Other annual seabirds include the Southern Giant Petrels. Leopard  seal are often seen prowling the shore for penguins.<br />\n  <strong>Deception Island,  Port Foster and Whalers Bay</strong> -Deception Island is an excellent example  of a breached caldera flood by seawater. We plan to sail into Port Foster  through a narrow entrance called Neptune’s Bellows. Our resident Geologist will  be on hand to explain the unique volcanic features of the area while our  naturalists might introduce you to the whaling history of Deception Island.  Still visible on the island are the boilers used to make whale oil in the early  1900s.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 11–12 — Drake  Passage Return </strong><br />\n  Navigating our  return through the Drake Passage, we will watch for seabirds and wildlife we may  have missed on the first leg. Take this opportunity to attend additional  presentations offered by the Expedition Team lecturers as we travel towards  Ushuaia.<br />\n  On the final day  our onboard Videographer will present the Voyage-DVD with all the highlights  and special encounters of our journey to Antarctica. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 — Ushuaia,  Argentina</strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver  Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Expedition  highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be  guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure  opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into  account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice conditions.

A mandatory safety drill will take place before you set sail. During the  afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and important members  of the crew. At sail away enjoy the mountain-lined shoreline of the Beagle  Channel while you leave Ushuaia and bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego, the “Land  at the End of the World”. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  The Expedition Team’s expert lecturers will present  ornithological and historical insights into the Falkland Islands, our first  destination. You might hear about the early European explorers and the  different attempts at settling the Falkland Islands/Malvinas. Get introduced to  the specific birdlife we expect to see during our stay by our onboard Ornithologist.</p>\n<p>Tonight, you are invited to attend a special Welcome  Aboard cocktail party hosted by the Captain, who will introduce his senior  officers.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 —&nbsp;&nbsp; West Point Island and  Saunders Island, Falkland Islands</strong><br />\n  Watch  for Peale’s dolphins and the distinctive black and white markings of the  Commerson’s dolphin as <em>Silver Explorer</em> approaches West Point Island during the early morning. Walk across rolling  moorland to reach colonies of Black-browed Albatrosses that nest side-by-side  with Rockhopper Penguins. The hospitable island owners are always happy to  answer your questions and share their stories while you have a cup of tea and  some home-baked cookies and cakes.</p>\n<p>During  lunch <em>Silver Explorer</em> will reposition  to Saunders Island, the second-largest of the offshore islands. Apart from its  historical importance –this is where the first British settlement was located-  Saunders’ wildlife is quite varied. Depending on the weather conditions we will  attempt a landing to see several penguin species, as well as other seabirds and  land birds. Gentoo Penguins and King Penguins reside in the open dune and sand  flat area, while Rockhopper Penguins, Imperial Shags and Black-browed  Albatrosses frequent Mount Richards. Other key bird species are the  Black–throated Finch, Ruddy-headed Goose and Falkland Steamer Duck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Stanley, Falkland Islands </strong><br />\n  Stanley  is the capital of the remote Falkland Islands, and has a distinct British  ambience. </p>\n<p>You can join a  classic ‘City Highlights’ tour which covers Stanley and the surrounding area.  This excursion passes by older and newer portions of Stanley, seeing the  shipwreck of the <em>Lady Elizabeth</em>, an  outdoor whale bone display, war memorials and the museum.</p>\n<p>Stroll through the charming streets of this colourful  little town, lined with quaint cottages and a variety of traditional pubs, and  visit the 19th-century Anglican cathedral. After the 1982 Falkland conflict  between Britain and Argentina the island has settled back to its quiet business  of raising sheep.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 5–6 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Binoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to  watch for seabirds and marine mammals. Gather in The Theatre to perhaps hear  about Captain Cook’s first visit to South Georgia or to learn about the  region’s endemic wildlife and remarkable nature. Our knowledgeable onboard experts  will present lectures and seminars in a variety of scientific fields. Other  onboard diversions may include photography workshops, Spa treatments, a workout  in the Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Days 7–9 — South Georgia </strong><br />\n  This breathtaking destination of towering snow-covered  mountains, mighty glaciers, and low-lying grasslands attracts an astounding  concentration of wildlife: Southern fur seals, southern elephant seals and a  variety of albatross species including Black-browed, Light-mantled Sooty,  Grey-headed and the spectacular Wandering Albatross, plus thousands of King and  hundreds of Macaroni Penguins.</p>\n<p>South Georgia is also linked to the early Antarctic  explorers. Captain James Cook first stepped ashore in 1775, but perhaps more  famous is Ernest Shackleton’s arrival in 1916 following the sinking of his ship <em>Endurance</em>. Visit the graves of  Shackleton and Frank Wild, and the whaling museum at Grytviken. Here are some  of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Cooper Bay -</strong>Enjoy a Zodiac cruise to  see Macaroni and Chinstrap Penguins on the rocks and in the water.<strong></strong><br />\n  <strong>Gold Harbour -</strong>A large King Penguin colony  can be found near Bertrab Glacier, while elephant seals can be seen sunning on  the beaches.<strong></strong><br />\n  <strong>Grytviken -</strong>Grytviken is a historic  whaling station. You can still see the remains of the activity, including  rusted hulls of long abandoned whaling and sealing ships, and some of the  working-areas. In the museum guests can learn about past whaling techniques and  view various exhibits on exploration and discovery.<strong> </strong>Visit the burial site of famous explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton.  The remains of his faithful companion Frank Wild have been brought here too.<strong></strong><br />\n  <strong>Salisbury Plain -</strong>Salisbury Plain is a  favourite breeding ground for hundreds of thousands of King Penguins. It is  amazing to see how they completely cover the beaches and hills.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Days 10–11 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Participate in onboard activities, listen to some of  the lectures given, relax in one of the lounges, or peruse an array of titles  and topics in the well-stocked Library. Take a stroll on deck and enjoy the  solitude and splendour of the vast sea and sky. During the cruise towards the  Antarctic Peninsula we might see some of the giant tabular icebergs coming from  the Weddell Sea. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 12–16 — Antarctica</strong><br />\n  A flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of  favourable sea and weather conditions. In the true spirit of expedition  cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best  course depending on weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter. Each  day we will attempt Zodiac departures, and, if conditions permit, we will  cruise amidst colourful icebergs or step ashore to visit a variety of penguin  rookeries and perhaps scientific research stations led by our team of natural  history experts. Here are some of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands </strong><br />\n  Awesome glaciers  greet us as we approach Elephant Island – so named for its former abundance of  elephant seals. In 1916, when Ernest Shackleton’s ship <em>Endurance</em> was crushed in pack ice in the Weddell Sea, the crew was  stranded here for 137 days. Elephant Island is home to several Chinstrap  Penguin rookeries, as well as old moss colonies. Weddell seals and Macaroni  Penguins can also be found on the spit of land Shackleton’s men named Point  Wild. A solitary statue can be seen there, honouring the Chilean captain Luis  Pardo, who took the cutter <em>Yelcho</em> across the Drake Passage to rescue Shackleton’s men.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 – Antarctic Sound </strong><br />\n  We will start our Antarctic experiences at the top of  the Antarctic Peninsula, venturing into Antarctic Sound and its magnificent  array of tabular icebergs, historical sites and Adelie and Gentoo Penguin  rookeries. Depending on weather and ice conditions <em>Silver Explorer</em> might visit Brown Bluff, Hope Bay and cruise the  Antarctic Sound.<br />\n  <strong>Brown Bluff,</strong> (a 2,200-foot bluff on the Antarctic continent) is an  ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of  reddish-brown volcanic rock. The coastal area at the base of Brown Bluff is  used by Adelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels as a breeding  area.

Remote and  otherworldly, Antarctica is irresistible for its spectacular icebergs and  calving glaciers, and for the possibility of up-close encounters with marine  mammals. Watch for seals sunbathing on slow-moving ice floes and for humpback,  Minke, and orca whales to surface from below the frigid waters in this  spectacular wilderness- surely events that you will not forget. <br />\n  <strong>Cuverville Island, Errera Channel </strong>has large, bare rock areas provide nesting sites for  Gentoo Penguins. Snow Petrels and Cape Petrels may be seen, and Wilson’s Storm  Petrels nest in the higher scree of the island. During Zodiac tours, we hope to  see hauled-out Weddell and leopard seals. Conditions permitting, we will  attempt to hike to the top of the island for some spectacular panoramic views<strong>.</strong><br />\n  <strong>Paradise Bay</strong> is well named for its spectacular scenery of  mountains, glaciers and icebergs. From the ship or Zodiac, observe Argentina’s “Base  Brown”, one of many Antarctic research stations, and view the wildlife from sea  level while cruising in our Zodiacs. There is a good chance you will come  across a crabeater seal relaxing on a nearby ice floe. Blue-eyed Shags nest in  the cliffs close to the base, while Brown Skuas like to be around the buildings.  Minke whales frequent the area.<br />\n  <strong>Petermann Island</strong> is named for geographer August Petermann and was  discovered by a German expedition in 1873-74.<strong> </strong>During our landing, we will be able to observe rookeries of Adelie  Penguins, Gentoo Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags. Petermann has various geological  features, especially rock surfaces showing glacial polish and some glacial  grooving. To reach Petermann Island the <strong>Lemaire  Channel</strong> has to be crossed. This is one of the most spectacular channels  with steep snow-covered mountains on both sides and icebergs of different sizes  at the southern end.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 16 — South Shetland Islands </strong><br />\n  The South Shetland Islands run parallel to the  Antarctic Peninsula and have both scientific stations and large penguin  colonies. Depending on conditions we might visit the Aitcho Islands, Deception  Island or Half Moon Island.<br />\n  <strong>Port Foster</strong> <strong>(Deception  Island)</strong> is an excellent example of a breached caldera flooded by seawater.  We plan to sail into Port Foster through a narrow entrance called Neptune’s  Bellows. Our resident Geologist will take the opportunity to explain the unique  volcanic features of the area, while our Historian might introduce you to the  whaling history of Deception Island. The British base’s Biscoe House was  destroyed by a mudflow after a volcanic eruption in the late 1960s but can  still clearly be seen. Depending on weather conditions several hikes to  viewpoints might be offered. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 17–18 — Drake Passage </strong><br />\n  The Drake Passage has a  notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to strong westerly winds and  the currents pushed through the ‘narrow’ gap between South American and the  Antarctic Peninsula. Spend some time on deck watching the horizon and the  variety of seabirds that glide in the air currents of our ship’s wake such as  the Black-browed Albatross, Sooty Shearwaters, and White-chinned Petrels. Take  this opportunity to attend additional presentations offered by the Expedition  Team lecturers as we travel towards Ushuaia.<br />\n  Our onboard  Photographer/Videographer will present the Voyage-DVD.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 19 — Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences  only and cannot be guaranteed.

This beautiful corner of the  Chilean fjords lies within the Alberto de Agostini National Park, Chile’s third  largest national park. This park - with its 14.600 km2 - includes all Chilean  islands south of the Strait of Magellan, including a portion of Tierra del  Fuego.<br />\n  The Garibaldi is an  impressive glacier on the south face of the Cordillera Darwin. During a Zodiac  cruise we will see the different shades of blue of the ice -with dozens of  waterfalls dotting the cliffs.<br />\n  In terms of wildlife  we can expect Andean Condor, a South American sea lion colony,  kingfishers, Kelp Geese,  Ashy-headed Geese, Flightless Steamer Ducks, Crested Ducks, and nesting  Imperial Shags among others.<br />\n  <br />\n  During the afternoon, <em>Silver Explorer </em>will sail out into  the Pacific Ocean to reach the entrance to the Strait of Magellan and our  experts will present talks in The Theatre. Today our lecturers will introduce  you to the natural and historical highlights of Chile’s Magallanes Region and its  capital Punta Arenas. </p>\n<p><b>Day 3 —Alberto de Agostini  National Park and Ainsworth Bay, Chile</b><br />\n  Today <em>Silver Explorer</em> will navigate past  Dawson Island –quite infamous in Chile’s modern-day history as a penal  settlement for political prisoners- into Almirantazgo Sound, to arrive at  Ainsworth Bay. The bay is within Alberto De Agostini National Park, a UNESCO  Biosphere Reserve. Depending on conditions, we intend to offer a Zodiac cruise  to see the Marinelli Glacier descending from Darwin Mountain Range. We also  intend to take a walk in the stunning sub-polar Magellanic forest teeming with  evergreens and deciduous trees. The bay promises a good chance of sighting&nbsp; Southern elephant seals, while nearby Tucker Island is known to have Magellanic  Penguins.</p>\n<p><b>Day 4 —Punta Arenas, Chile</b><br />\n  In Punta Arenas, the  capital of the region, you have two options: you can either drive to the estancia  El Galpón or see Punta Arenas’ highlights.<br />\n  At El Galpón you will  get an understanding of the procedure of the wool and the importance of cattle  and sheep to Patagonia and see a demonstration of sheep shearing. There is also  a guided path of local flora, while rheas and guanacos can be seen roaming  free. Visit their small museum and enjoy a cocktail before heading back to the  pier.<br />\n  The highlight tour of  Punta Arenas visits the Salesian Museum, the General Cemetery (a Chilean  National Monument), and the Plaza de Armas with some time to browse for  souvenirs or look at the stately homes of the late 19th and early 20th century  found around the Plaza de Armas.</p>\n<p><b>Day 5 — Montañas Fjord, Chile</b><br />\n  <em>Silver  Explorer</em> will cruise the  Chilean Fjords and head for&nbsp; the Montañas  Fjord in the late morning, early afternoon. <em>Silver  Explorer</em> will sail parallel to the Cordillera de Sarmiento where several  cascades and seven glaciers come down the steep sides of the mountains and  –conditions permitting- we might do a Zodiac cruise or even land for a short  hike. In the afternoon we will continue towards Puerto Natales. </p>\n<p><b>Day 6 — Puerto Natales, Chile</b><br />\n  From Puerto Natales  we will head out to Torres del Paine National Park by bus. This is considered  by many worldwide to be the most spectacular Reserve at the end of the world.  Covering an area of 242,000 hectares, the park is a fertile combination of  lakes, lagoons, waterfalls, glaciers, hills and spectacular peaks and is a  UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. On the way to Laguna Sarmiento we will stop for  photos of the free roaming guanacos, Andean Condors and other wildlife. We will  be see the Salto Grande waterfall, the famous Torres del Paine peaks (weather  permitting) and Nordenskjold Lake. Lunch will be had at the Serrano River area.  Within the park there will be three different options of walks and hikes  –depending on your fitness or willingness to exercise.</p>\n<p><b>Day 7 —  Cruising the Chilean Fjords and White Narrows, Chile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  Leaving  Puerto Natales, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will  reach the White Narrows and another spectacular facet of the vast expenses of Chile’s  largest national park, Bernardo O’Higgins. The famous White Narrows become  evident as mountains loom in on both sides of the fjord with hardy native  plants clinging to barren rock. With only approximately 80 meters (260 feet) of  clearance from either side of the passage, the sharp turns of the ship,  skillfully executed between rocky outcrops, are fascinating to watch from the outer  decks. On the transit through the breathtaking White Narrows, it is also  possible to see seals and dolphins plying the waters alongside the ship.<br />\n  Our course will take  us through the vast expense of the Chilean Fjords. We will sail through Chile’s  largest national park, Bernardo O’Higgins, heading north for another famous  narrow channel, the English Narrows. As <em>Silver  Explorer</em> sails past Wellington Island –at 5,556 km² Chile’s second-largest  island- our experts will continue to assist you on deck looking for birds and  mammals, while discussions and lecture will also take place in The Theatre.<br />\n  <br />\n<b>Day 8 — Cruise Pio XI Glacier and English  Narrows, Chile</b><br />\n  During the morning  attend lectures about the fjords’ natural history or perhaps a seminar. Birders  will want to know and see what species live in this area. We might still have a  chance to see Andean Condors majestically soaring above the hills and  mountains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Around lunchtime we  will visit the Pio XI Glacier. This tidewater glacier is 4.5 km wide and a  remarkable shade of brilliant blue. An outlet glacier of the South Patagonian  Ice Field, the Pio XI once extended out into the fjords whose waters we ply  today. </p>\n<p>In the evening  –actually during dinnertime- we will pass the English Narrows. Our Captain and  the local Chilean Pilots will expertly manoeuvre <em>Silver Explorer</em> through the slalom course of islands and channel  markers. At the narrowest part it has a width of 80 metres, permitting the  passage of only one vessel at a time. </p>\n<p><b>Day 9 — Tortel, Chile</b><br />\n  Our course will take <em>Silver Explorer</em> to Caleta Tortel, one of  the southernmost and until 2003 least connected settlements in Chile’s Aisén  Region (in Patagonia). The abundant cypress led to the founding of the village  and most houses are built on stilts along the shoreline of this hilly terrain.  There are no conventional streets; instead the houses are connected by wooden  walkways. We will explore the village –where a folkloric presentation awaits us  at the main plaza- and will take our Zodiacs to cruise through the channels and  the Baker River to visit “La Isla de los Muertos”, a small island used as a  cemetery in 1906. Both the village and the island have been declared National  Monuments.</p>\n<p><b>Day 10 — At sea, Chile</b><br />\n  Today <em>Silver Explorer</em> will venture again into  the Pacific and will round the Tres Montes and Taitao Peninsulas – the sea  tends to be rough, but the area is known for its whales and dolphins sightings.<br />\n  Watch  for cetaceans or relax in one of the lounges with that book you’ve been meaning  to read and meet up with new friends for cocktails. <br />\n  During  the night, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will pass  the Guaitecas Archipelago and will enter calm waters.</p>\n<p><b>Day 11 — Castro, Chile</b><br />\n  Chiloé  Island is home to an amazing collection of 150 Jesuit-built wooden churches,  houses raised up on poles out of the water, and more than 400 native plant varieties. <br />\n  We  head to the picturesque village of Dalcahue and a brief ferry ride to the  island of Quinchao, passing through Curaco de Velez. Black-necked Swans can  sometimes be seen here. We then head for Achao, which was founded by the  Jesuits in 1743. Achao is a lively town with boats arriving every day from all  the surrounding islands.<br />\n  We  will visit the Jesuit’s Achao Church, the oldest wooden structure in Chiloé and  a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Constructed in 1730, it contains beautiful baroque  imagery. We then visit the well-preserved Dalcahue Church with its galvanized  iron roof. The details and precision of the imagery carved by Jesuits from  locally grown Patagonian cypress, larch and luma trees are amazing -it was  declared a World Heritage site in 2000. <br />\n  For  lunch we head to Rilan, where a traditional “Pulmay” will be served. This is a  meal typical of Chiloe, consisting of shellfish, potatoes, chicken and smoked  meats cooked together in a pot (sometimes in an underground oven).There will be  a traditional folkloric presentation and a local fashion show of typical  dresses and materials.<br />\n  Alternatively,  visit three of the 16 UNESCO World Heritage Site churches on the island of  Chiloé in Vilupulli, Chonchi and Castro. Apart from the churches, the Museum of  Traditions will be visited in Chonchi. This small museum houses artefacts and  photos relating to Chiloe and Chonchi and recreates the feeling of Chonchi in  the early 20th century. The excursion ends with a visit to Castro’s handicraft  market.</p>\n<p><b>Day 12 —Puerto Montt, Chile</b><br />\n  Puerto Montt is the  starting point for our excursions to the Lake District and specifically Lago  Llanquihue.</p>\n<p>We will drive along  the southern shore of Chile’s second-largest lake and head for the Petrohué  waterfalls. These falls ‘connect’ Lago Esmeralda with Lago Llanquihue and we  will walk over to the viewing platforms of Chile’s best-known falls. Here we  will have an opportunity to see some of the local plants and endemic trees.  Later you will have the choice to either visit a typical Chilean farm to learn  about the traditions of southern Chile’s food, music, tools and the national  sport of rodeo –which is quite different from the North American version- or to  have lunch at a local restaurant and to explore the town of Puerto Varas.<br />\n  If you choose the  local farm, you will have lunch including empanadas, a tasty barbeque und  traditional German desserts –this area was first colonized by Germans in the  mid-19th century. You will also have the chance to learn the Chilean national  dance, the Cueca.<br />\n  If you choose Puerto  Varas, you will have time to explore the “City of Roses” –as Puerto Varas is  known- and to browse the small handicraft village and see some of the wooden  buildings for which the town was declared a “Heritage Zone”.</p>\n<p><b>Day 13 — Niebla, Chile</b><br />\n  During the late  morning <em>Silver Explorer</em> will anchor  in the Corral Bay halfway between Corral and Niebla. Niebla is a small village  on the banks of the Rio Valdivia where Chile’s Corral Bay meets the Pacific  Ocean. Today Niebla is a beach resort, but in 1671 it was a defensive fortress  built by the Spanish to prevent attacks from pirates and corsairs. </p>\n<p>Today you can either  drive to the charming river port city of Valdivia, where we will find an  interesting blend of influences from the native Mapuche, Spanish settlers, and  German immigrants, or take a catamaran on the river. In both cases you will  have time to see the town of Valdivia. The first German colonists arrived here  in 1849 and worked hard to develop Valdivia into one of southern Chile’s most  productive areas and their influence can be felt in every corner of this city.  The town was affected by the 1960 earthquake –the worst ever recorded- but  rebuilt with a strong German imprint. On our way to Valdivia we can see tracts  of land that are still under water as a result of the quake. We will visit the  river market and have a look at downtown Valdivia with its mix of old and  modern buildings. You will have to choose whether you would like to visit the  Fort at Niebla or enjoy fresh fish and crabs in Valdivia.</p>\n<p><b>Day 14 —At sea</b><br />\n  During the last day  of our voyage, edit your photos and videos, attend final presentations and  discussions and watch our Voyage-DVD prepared by the onboard Videographer.<br />\n  Following the  Humboldt Current, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will continue north along the Chilean coast, heading for the most populous area  of Central Chile -with the most important harbours, the seat of Parliament  (Valparaiso) and the capital (Santiago). <br />\n  <br />\n<b>Day 15 —Valparaiso, Chile</b><br />\n  While <em>Silver Explorer</em> approaches Valparaiso,  take in the sights of “The Pearl of the Pacific” –as the city is known in  Chile’s literature and music. Valparaiso’s historic hillside settlements  (including the still used funiculars) have been declared a UNESCO World  Heritage Site.<br />\n  After breakfast  disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Expedition  highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be  guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure  opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into  account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity.

Join us for a Sail  Away Cocktail on the outer decks as we sail away from Valparaiso’s Historic  Center (a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Later you will be introduced to your  Expedition Team. </p>\n<p>This evening the  Restaurant Manager and Executive Chef would like to invite you to the delights  of a specially prepared menu in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><b>Day 2 - At Sea</b><br />\n  Having left  Valparaiso behind, <em>Silver Explorer</em> will have to cover some 370 miles to reach the first of the Juan Fernandez  Islands the west. </p>\n<p>During our day  at sea we will cross the Humboldt Current and will be looking for the occasional  seabirds, perhaps spotting the Juan Fernandez Petrel. Our lecturers will  present talks about the natural history and other topics related to our next  destination, the Juan Fernandez Archipelago. </p>\n<p><b>Day 3 - Robinson  Crusoe, Juan Fernandez Archipelago, Chile</b><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will anchor in Cumberland Bay, not too far from the  main settlement and only village of Robinson Crusoe. Formerly it was called  “Mas a Tierra” (closer to land) as it is closer to mainland Chile than  Alexander Selkirk –a further 112 nautical miles to the west. In 1966 the  island’s name was changed to Robinson Crusoe, Daniel Defoe’s famous literary  character, hoping to attract more tourism. </p>\n<p>The island has  several historical facts that make it interesting: from its discovery by Juan  Fernandez to its use as a provisioning stop for pirates and explorers alike, a  penal colony during the Chilean independence movement, its various schemes of  exploitation, the connection to World War I, and finally the several tsunamis  that have caused the current village to be redesigned for safety.</p>\n<p>We will land at  San Juan Bautista in Cumberland Bay to offer several walks and hikes to various  lookout points –including Alexander Selkirk’s viewpoint- and to look for the  endemic plants and birds that have put Juan Fernandez on the list of UNESCO  Biosphere Reserves and the tentative UNESCO World Heritage list. Heading up to  the Plazoleta El Yunque (the anvil), we will hike through pine, cypress and  eucalyptus forests, but will also be able to see many of the local plants and  the Juan Fernandez Firecrown.</p>\n<p>Both hikes to  the viewpoints offer different views of Cumberland Bay and the surrounding  landscape, but from Selkirk’s lookout you can also see the barren eastern side  of Robinson Crusoe with the small island of Santa Clara in the background. </p>\n<p>An easy walk  will lead to the cliff where the projectiles shot at the German light cruiser <em>SMS Dresden</em> during WWI can still be  seen. During this walk it is normally possible to see the Juan Fernandez fur  seals in the water, while hummingbirds might frequent the shrubs and flowers  near the cemetery.<br />\n  <br />\n<b>Day 4 - Alexander  Selkirk, Juan Fernandez Archipelago, Chile</b><br />\n  Today we reach  one of the most isolated islands of Chile. Formerly called “Más Afuera” -which  clearly stated that is was “further away”- it received the name of Alexander  Selkirk in 1966 to entice tourism to the archipelago, but not to the island.  Alexander Selkirk is only sporadically used by fishermen from Robinson Crusoe  to harvest spiny lobster. There is a small group of buildings on the island’s  eastern shore, but landing is conditioned by swell.</p>\n<p>We will use the  Zodiacs for a cruise along the shore, looking for the feral goats that were  left in the archipelago already in the 16th century, and the Juan Fernandez fur  seal colonies on the western coast. If possible we will go ashore near one of  the colonies. </p>\n<p><b>Days 5-8 - At Sea</b><br />\n  After leaving  Alexander Selkirk almost 1400 nautical miles will have to be covered before  reaching Salas y Gomez. During our days at sea we will be looking for large schools  of dolphins that have been observed on this transect before.<br />\n  Our lecturers  will present talks about Chile, the Pacific Ocean and obviously topics related  to our next destination, Easter Island, and the famous statues. Attend  workshops and seminars, relax, enjoy the solitude of the open ocean, and sample  the culinary specialities prepared by our Executive Chef and his team.</p>\n<p><b>Day 9 - Isla Salas y Gomez </b><br />\n  We will approach  Salas y Gomez during the early morning. We will take our Zodiacs to  circumnavigate the island and some of the submerged rocks. In terms of wildlife  we can expect to see Christmas Shearwater, Brown Noddies, Masked Boobies, as  well as Great Frigatebirds and Sooty Terns –the last two of prime importance to  Easter Island’s socio-religious birdman cult. </p>\n<p>In the  afternoon our onboard Videographer will present the DVD-documentary of our  voyage.<br />\n  <br />\n<b>Day 10 - Easter  Island, Chile</b><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will sail along Easter Island’s coast, part of the  Rapa Nui National Park –a UNESCO World Heritage Site- at dawn and will anchor  in front of Hanga Roa, the island’s only settlement at sunrise. <br />\n  After breakfast  disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed  here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

We will start  in the Historic Centre of Valparaiso (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) and cross  the Humboldt Current to reach the Juan Fernandez Archipelago. Alexander  Selkirk, the Scotsman who inspired Daniel Defoe to write Robinson Crusoe, was  marooned on the island that was then known as “Mas-a-Tierra”. Colloquially  known as Juan Fernandez, and renamed after Defoe’s hero, we will go ashore at  Robinson Crusoe, not only looking for traces of the real Robinson’s stay, but  also looking for the endemic plants and animals that thrive in this Chilean  national park –placed on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and  one of the oldest UNESCO Biosphere Reserves in the world.

Gather in The Theatre for staff introductions and briefings on Zodiac safety.  The members of the Expedition Team, all knowledgeable experts in their various  scientific fields, will present lectures about the rarely visited islands and  archipelagoes that we will visit. Topics will include botany, anthropology and  ornithology, and prepare you for the adventures to come. As our voyage follows  to a certain degree the route of <em>HMS  Bounty</em>, our Historian will also describe how our itinerary is connected to  the famous breadfruit-expedition of William Bligh and Fletcher Christian.</p>\n<p>Other  onboard diversions may include photographic workshops, Spa treatments, and a  workout in the Fitness Centre.</p>\n<p><b>Day 4 — Ducie Atoll, Pitcairn  Islands, UK</b><br />\n  Ducie, a small  isolated atoll, is the easternmost of the Pitcairn Islands. A mere speck in the  surrounding expanse of ocean, uninhabited except for thousands of nesting  seabirds that reside among the two plant species (beach heliotrope and at least  one specimen of <em>Pemphis</em>) that grow  over seventy percent of the island. Bird species we should be able see include  Murphy's Petrels, Common White Terns, Great Frigatebirds and Masked Boobies.  Few have ever snorkelled on top of the remains of the <em>Acadia</em>, wrecked in 1881, or in the atoll’s lagoon waters. If  conditions permit, this will surely be a highlight of the voyage.</p>\n<p><b>Day 5 — Henderson, Pitcairn  Islands, UK</b><br />\n  We intend to go  ashore on this remote and uninhabited raised coral island on its northern  shore. Although inhabited by Polynesians a few hundred years ago, Henderson’s isolation  has led to its primary attraction: four endemic land birds. The onboard  Ornithologist would like to lead a guided nature walk, hoping to spot the  flightless Henderson Rail, Stephen’s (or Henderson) Lorikeet, the Henderson  Fruit-dove, and the Henderson Reed Warbler. The island is also known to have  ten endemic species of plant life. To protect the rare, natural state of  Henderson Island, UNESCO designated it as a World Heritage Site in 1988.<br />\n  If conditions permit,  snorkelling off anchored Zodiacs will be offered.</p>\n<p><b>Day 6 —  Pitcairn Island, Pitcairn Islands, UK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><br />\n  Halfway  between Peru and New Zealand, Pitcairn was the perfect hiding spot for the  famed <em>HMS</em> <em>Bounty</em> mutineers and their Tahitian wives. Not  only had the island been misplaced on early maps of the region, but it can also  be very difficult to come ashore as large breakers tend to build up just in  front of the small harbour of Bounty Bay. Depending on the sea conditions, we  will either go ashore by Zodiac, or will have the privilege to use one of  Pitcairn’s longboats.<br />\n  <br />\n  Our  goal is to visit with the islanders, descendants of the <em>Bounty</em> crew, and get a sense of their daily lives, far removed from  the rest of the world. Listen to their distinct dialect, a combination of  18th-century English and Tahitian, and explore the island, either on your own  or accompanied by one of our experts. We plan to visit the museum, the  cemetery, the school and will hike towards Fletcher  Christian’s cave. Birders should be on  the lookout for the endemic Pitcairn Reed Warbler, while stamp collectors will certainly want to purchase a  few of the coveted Pitcairn Island stamps to keep as reminders of their visit  to this remote island. Pitcairn Island cook books, hand-carved replicas of the  Bounty, walking canes, and other souvenirs will be set up at Adamstown’s  meeting ground next to the church and post office. </p>\n<p><b>Day 7 — Oeno, Pitcairn Islands, UK</b><br />\n  Located  120 kilometres northwest of Pitcairn, Oeno is a beautiful low-lying island  rarely visited. Oeno used to be the island Pitcairn Islanders went to on their  ‘holidays’. The little island is surrounded by white sandy beaches inside a  lagoon. A sand bar, which is constantly undergoing change, is currently  unattached to the island. The island is home to a number of seabirds -such as  Murphy's Petrels, Sooty Terns and Brown Noddies.<br />\n  Access  to the island is quite limited, as the currents close to the channel leading to  the island can be quite strong and one has to carefully navigate around the  many coral heads.</p>\n<p><b>Day 8 — Mangareva, Gambier  Islands, French Polynesia</b><br />\n  Mangareva is the main  island of the Gambier Islands and together with Taravai, Akamaru, Aukena and  several smaller islands is the visible part of an old volcano. <br />\n  Before the large  lagoon had been used for black pearl farming, local divers brought up black-lip  pearl oysters for their mother-of-pearl and used them for trade. Mangareva is  known as the cradle of Catholicism in French Polynesia and in the mid-19th  century St. Michael’s Cathedral was built using large amounts of  mother-of-pearl shells to decorate the altar. The building has recently been  renovated and to see the workmanship of the locals we will visit the church. The  church is still involved in teaching students how to engrave mother-of-pearl  shells and we intend to visit their workshop. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n  If possible, we will  visit a pearl farm and can swim and snorkel in the lagoon.</p>\n<p><b>Days 9-10 — At Sea</b><br />\n  As the <em>Silver Explorer</em> travels towards the  Austral Islands, we will learn about the residents of these remote islands –not  only humans, but also plants and animals.<br />\n  When not attending a  lecture or relaxing on the Sun Deck, get help from the onboard Photographer  during a workshop or contemplate the wide expanse of the South Pacific while <em>Silver Explorer </em>will sail in a westerly  direction to reach Raivavae. </p>\n<p><b>Day 11 — Raivavae, Austral  Islands, French Polynesia</b><br />\n  Our first stop in the  Austral Islands has been described as a small and laid-back version of Bora  Bora –without the tourists. We will land on Raivavae’s north shore to  semi-circumnavigate the island by local bus. A stop will be made at a marae  where one of the few tiki carved on Raivavae can still be seen in a private  garden. Once past the airport –which had to be built in the lagoon because  there was not enough flat space on land- we will come to meet our Zodiacs again  on the southeast side to be transferred across the lagoon to Motu Vaiamanu. This  is the typical South Sea paradise one expects: crystal clear waters, white  sandy beaches, pandanus and coconut palm trees, with reef fish for snorkelers  to enjoy and tropicbirds, reef herons, noddies and the occasional shorebird for  our birders. If you just want to relax on the beach listen to the local  musicians and taste some of the local delicacies prepared for you.</p>\n<p><b>Day 12 — Tubuai</b><br />\n  Tubuai is the  administrative centre for the Austral Islands, but is probably best-known for  the role it played in the selection of a home for the <em>Bounty</em> mutineers before they finally landed on Pitcairn. We will  get to see where the mutineers’ settlement Fort George was meant to be built  –only impressions of the moat are still visible- and will see two of the  important marae (ancient ceremonial sites). <br />\n  If you want some  exercise, a guided walk of some 7km will cross the island and even a strenuous  hike to the top of the island (some 422 metres above sea level) could be done if  it has not rained. </p>\n<p><b>Day 13 — At Sea</b><br />\n  Join our experts in  The Theatre for the final fascinating lectures about French Polynesia and attend  a briefing on the variety of activities that will be on offer while in Bora  Bora and other important information needed to make the most of your time  ashore. </p>\n<p>Join  our Videographer to view the video presentation of our journey so far. Tonight  the Captain would like to invite you to his Farewell Cocktail Reception and the  Restaurant Manager and Executive Chef have prepared a special Farewell Dinner. </p>\n<p><b>Day 14 — Bora Bora, Society  Islands</b><br />\n  No  superlatives can adequately describe the spectacular beauty of Bora Bora's  emerald-green hills and tranquil sapphire-blue lagoons. <em>Silver Explorer</em> will enter the narrow channel into the lagoon at  dawn. Be out on deck to watch the sun rise behind Mount Pahia and Otemanu and  look for dolphins playing at the entrance to the lagoon.<br />\n  Select  from a variety of excursions and activities today. Enjoy a leisurely, open-air  ‘le truck’ tour of Bora Bora’s highlights: ancient marae stone temples, the  Faanui Protestant Church, scenic lookout points with spectacular vistas of the  lagoon and distant islands, old WWII remnants and popular Matira Beach. Sample local  fruits and watch a pareo (sarong) demonstration before returning to the ship.</p>\n<p>Alternatively,  climb into a specially designed, open-air, off-road vehicle, to circle the  island and visit some of its most dramatic sites that are only accessible by  four-wheel drive. Veer inland following a trail that leads up the mountain to  an amazing 360-degree panorama. From this height, you can view Bora Bora’s  breathtaking multi-coloured lagoon. See canons remaining from the American’s  presence during WWII. </p>\n<p><i>Optional flight excursion:<br />\n  Perhaps the most spectacular way to see  Bora Bora is from the air on a helicopter flyover. This optional flight aboard  a 5-seat “Squirrel” helicopter circles the island for spectacular views of the  lagoon fringed with white sandy beaches and a network of smaller islets.</i> </p>\n<p>If  you would like to see Bora Bora’s underwater world, a snorkel safari permits  you to swim with rays and with reef sharks.<br />\n  <br />\n&nbsp;<b>Day 15 —Papeete, French Polynesia</b><br />\n  After breakfast,  disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.<br />\n</p>\n<p><em>Expedition  highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be  guaranteed.

The  Connoisseur’s Corner and Panorama Lounge with coffee, tea, cocktails, fine  spirits and cigars will offer shelter from the sun –while our Executive Chef  and his team will tempt you with South Pacific delicacies.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Aitutaki, Cook Islands</strong><br />\n  Aitutaki is rightly known as one of the most  spectacular destinations in the Cook Islands. Its reef completely encompasses a  large turquoise lagoon. We board the Zodiacs and will enter a narrow channel  leading to the island’s main village -but before coming ashore a local warrior  will appear and challenge all visitors. Local tradition requires stepping  across a special stone, and then visitors are free to do as they please on the  island. <br />\n  Our excursion continues aboard local boats, crossing  the spectacular lagoon to the small islet of Tapuaetai for a delicious barbecue  luncheon in a lush South Pacific setting. Look for Red-tailed Tropicbirds or  take your snorkelling gear to see the underwater world. You can also stroll  along the beach out onto a sand cay. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Palmerston, Cook Islands</strong><br />\n  During the late morning, we approach the low-lying  atoll of Palmerston and Home Islet where three families, all descendants of  William Marsters (1831-1899) live a simple life. Several of the men will come  out to guide our Zodiacs into the lagoon. Once ashore, the whole community will  be there to greet us. This will be followed by a presentation of speeches,  prayers and church songs. Afterwards we will tour the island in small groups to  see its highlights: the church, the oldest house, the cemetery, the school, the  underground gardens and “Duke’s Pool” where we will be invited to swim and  snorkel.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 —&nbsp;&nbsp; Beveridge  Reef, Niue</strong><br />\n  Attend lectures or seminars during the morning. <br />\n  At lunchtime <em>Silver  Explorer</em> will approach Beveridge Reef and look for a protected area to  offer swimming and snorkelling at this eastern outpost of Niue. Only small  portions of the reef are above sea level at high tide so we will use our  Zodiacs as snorkelling platforms from where to explore this rarely visited part  of the Pacific.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 —&nbsp;&nbsp; Alofi,  Niue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Crossing the Dateline)</strong><br />\n  Today <em>Silver  Explorer</em> will drift in front of “the Rock” -as Niue is locally known. The  island is one of the largest raised coral atolls in the Pacific. As such it has  no lagoon and the coastline shows steep cliffs. <br />\n  Once ashore, we will take locals busses to see some of  the scenic and historical highlights of the island. The coast features various  caves that can be visited and there are two areas where snorkelling can be  done. Not only are Niue’s waters crystal clear, the island is also known as a  hotspot for black-banded sea kraits –we should be able to see them at the  landing sites or while snorkelling.<br />\n  In the afternoon, <em>Silver  Explorer</em> will head for Tonga and all of us become time travellers! Crossing  the dateline in a westerly direction (but actually not yet leaving the western  hemisphere) we will lose a day. Our lecturers will use this time to prepare you  for Tonga. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 —&nbsp;&nbsp; Neiafu  and Nuku, Vava’u Archipelago, Tonga</strong><br />\n  The Vava’u Archipelago is quite famous for its raised  islands and has one of the most picturesque harbours. We will either be  alongside in Neiafu or anchor close to elegant yachts in the bay, and once  ashore, begin our visit with an excursion to the Botanical Garden. A  knowledgeable local guide will describe the heritage of the island’s plant life  and specifically point out species that have medicinal properties. Enjoy  traditional entertainment and a chance to shop for arts and handicrafts before  returning the ship.</p>\n<p>For guests wanting a more leisurely morning, a walking  tour of Neiafu might be of interest.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon <em>Silver  Explorer</em> will relocate to Nuku Island via the Ava Pulepule Kai Channel. You  can spend the afternoon ashore and relax on the beach or swim and snorkel. We  might also take to the Zodiacs to explore some of the islands. Various types of  seabirds nest or roost here, and we may even see flying foxes hanging in the  trees and swiftlets that nest in caves.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Uoleva, Ha’apai Group, Tonga</strong><br />\n  Our final stop in Tonga will be in the rarely visited  Ha’apai Group, south of Neiafu. <em>Silver  Explorer</em> will anchor in front of Uoleva, an island of palm forests, endless  beaches, and clear blue water. Today will be a day to unwind, to swim and  snorkel, and to feel the true South Pacific.<br />\n  Depending on permits and conditions, our Hotel  Department will arrange for a beach barbecue and beach bar –so that you can  make the most of your day ashore.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Today will be a day to scan the seas for seabirds as  we head for Fiji, travelling on a course that was taken almost exactly 230  years ago by Lt. William Bligh and his loyal crew members after the mutiny on  the <em>Bounty</em> near Uoleva. <br />\n  Our lecturers will want to talk about Fiji’s natural  history and topics relevant to the area <em>Silver  Explorer</em> will be travelling through. You can also make use of the Spa and  Gym, or relax on the Sun Deck. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Vanua Balavu, Fiji</strong><br />\n  Vanua Balavu, the third largest of the Lau Islands, is  protected by a reef area that promises excellent snorkelling: snorkelling from  the beach, snorkelling from an anchored Zodiac or perhaps even drift snorkelling  –depending on conditions. <br />\n  We also hope to visit one of the villages, where a  yaqona (kava) ceremony will be held to welcome us. A hike from one village to  the next or up into the higher areas of Vanua Balavu will appeal to those  wanting to stretch their legs. As the Lau Group was once under Tongan rule, we  are looking forward to a folkloric presentation in which Fijian and Tongan  music and dance have formed a special union.<br />\n  If conditions permit we will also take our Zodiacs to  explore the bay and the many photogenic little islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Cobia Island and Ringgold Isles, Fiji</strong><br />\n  Cobia Island is part of the Ringgold Isles, a small  group of islands to the northeast of Taveuni. Cobia is the lush remnant of a  former volcano with two small white sand beaches. The crater’s rim has  disappeared on the northeastern side and has permitted seawater to come in,  forming a beautiful blue lagoon.&nbsp;<br />\n  <br />\n  One of the main attractions on the island would be a hike to the summit of the  crater. To do so we will land on the south side of the island for those that  want to climb the crater’s rim for a spectacular view of the interior of the  crater. After the hike you can relax on the beach or go snorkelling in the clear  waters; visibility is said to exceed 120 feet. Conditions and permits pending,  we might also explore the lagoon inside the crater by Zodiac. <br />\n  <br />\n  The seven Ringgold Islands are considered rat-free  after and hold internationally important numbers of nesting seabirds. Bridled  Terns have been observed on two of the islands. Lesser Frigatebird, Black Noddy&nbsp;and Brown Booby are  said to represent over 1% of the global number for each species, thereby  qualifying the island group as an Important Bird Area. Other birds include  Red-footed Boobies<em>,</em>&nbsp;Brown Noddies, Common White Terns, and  Bristle-thighed Curlews. Three of the islands have significant numbers of  turtle nests and the sea surrounding the Ringgold Islands is the main foraging  area for hawksbill and green turtles. The Pacific Black Skink, listed under  Fiji’s Endangered and Protected Species Act, has also increased in numbers.<br />\n  We will explore some of the islands with our Zodiacs  and depending on conditions might go ashore, will be looking for the birds and  might also look for underwater creatures while snorkelling.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 — Nabukeru, Yasawa Islands, Fiji</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Explorer</em> will anchor  in Buasali Bay, right off the village of Nabukeru and next to one of the Yasawa  Islands most famous islands: Sawa-i-Lau. We will go ashore to visit the village  and its school, which is shared with the neighbouring village of Tamusua.  Village visits are normally accompanied by a kava ceremony in which the guests  (in this case us) bring a gift of yaqona (kava roots) and then drink the ground  up roots mixed with water. <br />\n  Apart from the village and school visit, a climb to  the hilltop behind the two villages for spectacular panoramic views of the  northern Yasawas will be offered. If you do not want to partake in the strenuous  hike, relax on one of the beaches, go swimming and snorkelling in the bay, or  venture into the island of Sawa-i-Lau. This limestone island has caves in which  one can swim.<br />\n  Enjoy sundowners on deck as <em>Silver Explorer</em> leaves Buasali Bay for our final destination,  Lautoka.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 — Lautoka, Viti Levu Island, Fiji</strong><br />\n  We  will arrive in port in the morning. Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Explorer</em>.<br />\n  <em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are  possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and  Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and  exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather,  wildlife activity and sea conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p>You will visit one of the most unusual islands in the Galápagos on the North Central Route: Genovesa with its collapsed caldera. The island is a birder’s paradise. Española is the most southerly island and one of the richest in terms of wildlife; it is the only nesting place in the world for the Waved Albatross.</p>\n<p>Expedition Highlights:<br />\n  •\tVisit “Bird Island” -home to over 30 bird species<br />\n  •\tClimb Prince Philip’s Steps to see a thriving seabird colony and search for the Galapagos Short-eared Owl<br />\n  •\tObserve sea lion families and the famed giant tortoises and marvel at the fearless behaviour of wildlife<br />\n  •\tAdmire the antics of Red-footed and Blue-footed Boobies<br />\n  •\tHike up the sides of an extinct volcano and hike across lava flows<br />\n  •\tSee the Waved Albatross<br />\n  •\tSwim and snorkel in tranquil, clear waters<br />\n  •\tPhotograph colourful marine iguanas<br />\n  •\tCruise by Zodiac along scenic coastlines<br />\n  •\tLearn about conservation efforts at the “Fausto Llerena Breeding Center”</p>\n<p>Day 1 — Baltra<br />\n  Embark Silver Galapagos and depart on your exciting Silversea Expedition — North Central Galápagos. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.<br />\n  Silver Galapagos will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, frigatebirds, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls. <br />\n  In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin and El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island<br />\n  Genovesa (“Tower “in English) is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a birdwatcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded: a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for storm petrels, a favourite prey. After a morning walk, we will have a chance to enjoy our first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.<br />\n  We will also have the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p>\n<p>Day 3 — North Seymour and Sullivan Bay, Santiago<br />\n  North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife — above and below the sea. Two species of frigatebirds nest here; one of which, the Magnificent Frigatebird, is an opportunistic breeder. At any month of the year we may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females. Galapagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. We will walk through this spectacular landscape, and afterwards have an opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark. </p>\n<p>Coming ashore on the east coast of Santiago Island, we will witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. Our landing will be on a white sandy beach or directly onto lava — depending on the conditions. In either case we will see the lava flows that are not much older than a hundred years — dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that supposedly suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava. As the sun heats up the lava during the day, at the time of our visit the temperatures will have you back at the sandy beach and getting ready for snorkelling in due time. While we will look for shelter from the heat at the beach, be aware that animals like beaches, too. Apart from rays, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p>\n<p>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden Islet, Santa Cruz<br />\n  Rabida is a small picturesque island with red rock cliffs and maroon sand. Here we can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galapagos Mockingbirds. Take a walk along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast, while an underwater world teeming with colourful tropical species and vibrant submarine landscapes is equally amazing. After a short but rewarding hike, we will have the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. You can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.<br />\n  Sail to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galapagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles, they make an excellent spot for kayaking as well.</p>\n<p>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristobal<br />\n  The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galapagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the tenacious work of the Galápagos National Park Service park rangers and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. We’ll see these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.<br />\n  San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galapagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. We may see three species of boobies here: Red-footed, Blue-footed<br />\n  and Nazca, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, we’ll climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide our way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p>\n<p>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española<br />\n  Don’t miss a chance to swim with sea lions from the gorgeous beach at Gardner Bay. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic beach as the water laps gently in front of you. You may even spy some iguanas on the shore. Further out you can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while a whitetip reef shark naps on the bottom. You may wish to experience this from a kayak: paddling through crystal clear waters while marvelling at the natural wonders all around you.<br />\n  In the afternoon, we will visit Punta Suárez at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galapagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies<br />\n  and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December, and has made Española<br />\n  its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galapagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p>\n<p>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz, and Plazas Sur<br />\n  We will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora. The Station is the operative branch of the Charles Darwin Foundation, an organisation established in 1959 to provide conservation counsel to the Ecuadorian government. Its flagship program is the restoration of Galapagos giant tortoises.<br />\n  At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, we will get to see tortoises of both morphotypes: dome-shaped and saddle-backed, as well as young giant tortoises up to 5 years old that are waiting to be returned<br />\n  to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galapagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals such as dogs and cats, but they have had a comeback thanks<br />\n  to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station. Towards the end of the morning, <br />\n  there will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town.<br />\n  South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galapagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cacti, the reddish sesuvium plants, forming a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galapagos sea lions are also around.</p>\n<p>Day 8 — San Cristobal<br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark Silver Galapagos for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p>\n<p>According to the Galapagos National Park Rules it is not allowed to use drones or poles for smartphones in the park.<br />\n</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p>The Western Islands are home to the only active volcanoes in the archipelago and are known both for their spectacular volcanic landscapes as well as penguin spotting: over 95% of the Galapagos Penguins live in these islands. It’s also the only area to see the endemic Flightless Cormorant. Other key sites include the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Post Office Bay with its human history and Champion Islet with some of the best snorkelling in the archipelago. <br />\n  Expedition Highlights:<br />\n  • See penguins along the rocky shores and watch for the unique species of Flightless Cormorant<br />\n  • Swim with green sea turtles, sea lions and manta rays<br />\n  • Hike through fragrant forests of palo santo “Incense” trees<br />\n  • Encounter the largest colony of marine iguanas and see land iguanas at Cerro Dragon<br />\n  • Visit one of the most volcanically active places on Earth and walk across spectacular lava fields<br />\n  • See wild flamingos (in season) and nesting sea turtles and observe giant tortoises and sea lion colonies<br />\n  • Photograph iconic Pinnacle Rock</p>\n<p>Day 1 — San Cristobal <br />\n  Embark Silver Galapagos for your exciting Silversea Expedition – Western Galápagos.  After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team. <br />\n  During the late afternoon Silver Galapagos will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands. <br />\n  In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.<br />\n  Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago<br />\n  Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galapagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater. </p>\n<p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We’ll walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches.</p>\n<p>At times of year when conditions aren’t ideal at Espumilla, you’ll enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove.  This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays.  You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting native seabirds (like the Brown Noddy) that nest in the cliffs. </p>\n<p>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina<br />\n  Five (originally six) majestic shield volcanoes up to half-a-million years old pierce the arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos. Snorkelling is probably the best (and coldest) in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano (northwest Isabela). Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for an array of seabirds including Flightless Cormorants and penguins.</p>\n<p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the north-eastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant. </p>\n<p>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela<br />\n  A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings us to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galapagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area in a kayak. </p>\n<p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary. (No landings permitted.)</p>\n<p>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana<br />\n  Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when pirates sought shelter in its caves and at a later stage whalers hunted the island for tortoises. Sailors established a rustic mailing system here: a barrel nailed to a pole where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Then take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in an underwater world as colourful as Floreana’s history. </p>\n<p>You'll have an opportunity to get to know the flora and fauna of this island. On the northern coast (between Punta Cormorant and Post Office Bay), a sea lion rockery has developed. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters. </p>\n<p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature. There is so much to explore in Floreana.</p>\n<p>Where in the world can you see an olivine beach, deciduous vegetation and pink flamingos all in one place? Only at Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands. We will learn about the formation of beaches as we land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p>\n<p>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz<br />\n  Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park.  When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.<br />\n  There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.<br />\n  Silver Galapagos will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them. </p>\n<p>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz<br />\n  The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters (similar to sink holes) in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. Here there’s a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galapagos Martins.</p>\n<p>Tortoises in the Galápagos occur in two different morphotypes: dome-shaped and saddlebacked. The smaller saddleback tortoise was hunted virtually to extinction and just a handful of survivors remain. The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p>\n<p>Day 8 — Baltra<br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark Silver Galapagos for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions. Expedition Team members scheduled for this voyage are subject to change or cancellation.</p>\n<p>Please note that according to the Galapagos National Park Rules it is not allowed to use drones or poles for smartphones in the park.</p>\n<p>GEAR UP  <br />\n  Not sure what to wear while on board?

After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.<br />\n  Silver Galapagos will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, frigatebirds, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls. <br />\n  In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin and El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island<br />\n  Genovesa (“Tower “in English) is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a birdwatcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded: a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for storm petrels, a favourite prey. After a morning walk, we will have a chance to enjoy our first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.<br />\n  We will also have the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p>\n<p>Day 3 — North Seymour and Sullivan Bay, Santiago<br />\n  North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife — above and below the sea. Two species of frigatebirds nest here; one of which, the Magnificent Frigatebird, is an opportunistic breeder. At any month of the year we may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females. Galapagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. We will walk through this spectacular landscape, and afterwards have an opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark. </p>\n<p>Coming ashore on the east coast of Santiago Island, we will witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. Our landing will be on a white sandy beach or directly onto lava — depending on the conditions. In either case we will see the lava flows that are not much older than a hundred years — dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that supposedly suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava. As the sun heats up the lava during the day, at the time of our visit the temperatures will have you back at the sandy beach and getting ready for snorkelling in due time. While we will look for shelter from the heat at the beach, be aware that animals like beaches, too. Apart from rays, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p>\n<p>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden Islet, Santa Cruz<br />\n  Rabida is a small picturesque island with red rock cliffs and maroon sand. Here we can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galapagos Mockingbirds. Take a walk along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast, while an underwater world teeming with colourful tropical species and vibrant submarine landscapes is equally amazing. After a short but rewarding hike, we will have the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. You can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.<br />\n  Sail to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galapagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles, they make an excellent spot for kayaking as well.</p>\n<p>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristobal<br />\n  The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galapagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the tenacious work of the Galápagos National Park Service park rangers and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. We’ll see these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.<br />\n  San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galapagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. We may see three species of boobies here: Red-footed, Blue-footed<br />\n  and Nazca, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, we’ll climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide our way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p>\n<p>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española<br />\n  Don’t miss a chance to swim with sea lions from the gorgeous beach at Gardner Bay. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic beach as the water laps gently in front of you. You may even spy some iguanas on the shore. Further out you can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while a whitetip reef shark naps on the bottom. You may wish to experience this from a kayak: paddling through crystal clear waters while marvelling at the natural wonders all around you.<br />\n  In the afternoon, we will visit Punta Suárez at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galapagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies<br />\n  and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December, and has made Española<br />\n  its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galapagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p>\n<p>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz, and Plazas Sur<br />\n  We will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora. The Station is the operative branch of the Charles Darwin Foundation, an organisation established in 1959 to provide conservation counsel to the Ecuadorian government. Its flagship program is the restoration of Galapagos giant tortoises.<br />\n  At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, we will get to see tortoises of both morphotypes: dome-shaped and saddle-backed, as well as young giant tortoises up to 5 years old that are waiting to be returned<br />\n  to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galapagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals such as dogs and cats, but they have had a comeback thanks<br />\n  to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station. Towards the end of the morning, <br />\n  there will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town.<br />\n  South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galapagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cacti, the reddish sesuvium plants, forming a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galapagos sea lions are also around.</p>\n<p>Day 8 — San Cristobal<br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark Silver Galapagos for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p>\n<p>According to the Galapagos National Park Rules it is not allowed to use drones or poles for smartphones in the park.<br />\n</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p>The Western Islands are home to the only active volcanoes in the archipelago and are known both for their spectacular volcanic landscapes as well as penguin spotting: over 95% of the Galapagos Penguins live in these islands. It’s also the only area to see the endemic Flightless Cormorant. Other key sites include the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Post Office Bay with its human history and Champion Islet with some of the best snorkelling in the archipelago. <br />\n  Expedition Highlights:<br />\n  • See penguins along the rocky shores and watch for the unique species of Flightless Cormorant<br />\n  • Swim with green sea turtles, sea lions and manta rays<br />\n  • Hike through fragrant forests of palo santo “Incense” trees<br />\n  • Encounter the largest colony of marine iguanas and see land iguanas at Cerro Dragon<br />\n  • Visit one of the most volcanically active places on Earth and walk across spectacular lava fields<br />\n  • See wild flamingos (in season) and nesting sea turtles and observe giant tortoises and sea lion colonies<br />\n  • Photograph iconic Pinnacle Rock</p>\n<p>Day 1 — San Cristobal <br />\n  Embark Silver Galapagos for your exciting Silversea Expedition – Western Galápagos.  After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team. <br />\n  During the late afternoon Silver Galapagos will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands. <br />\n  In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.<br />\n  Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago<br />\n  Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galapagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater. </p>\n<p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We’ll walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches.</p>\n<p>At times of year when conditions aren’t ideal at Espumilla, you’ll enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove.  This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays.  You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting native seabirds (like the Brown Noddy) that nest in the cliffs. </p>\n<p>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina<br />\n  Five (originally six) majestic shield volcanoes up to half-a-million years old pierce the arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos. Snorkelling is probably the best (and coldest) in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano (northwest Isabela). Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for an array of seabirds including Flightless Cormorants and penguins.</p>\n<p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the north-eastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant. </p>\n<p>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela<br />\n  A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings us to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galapagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area in a kayak. </p>\n<p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary. (No landings permitted.)</p>\n<p>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana<br />\n  Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when pirates sought shelter in its caves and at a later stage whalers hunted the island for tortoises. Sailors established a rustic mailing system here: a barrel nailed to a pole where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Then take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in an underwater world as colourful as Floreana’s history. </p>\n<p>You'll have an opportunity to get to know the flora and fauna of this island. On the northern coast (between Punta Cormorant and Post Office Bay), a sea lion rockery has developed. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters. </p>\n<p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature. There is so much to explore in Floreana.</p>\n<p>Where in the world can you see an olivine beach, deciduous vegetation and pink flamingos all in one place? Only at Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands. We will learn about the formation of beaches as we land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p>\n<p>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz<br />\n  Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park.  When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.<br />\n  There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.<br />\n  Silver Galapagos will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them. </p>\n<p>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz<br />\n  The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters (similar to sink holes) in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. Here there’s a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galapagos Martins.</p>\n<p>Tortoises in the Galápagos occur in two different morphotypes: dome-shaped and saddlebacked. The smaller saddleback tortoise was hunted virtually to extinction and just a handful of survivors remain. The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p>\n<p>Day 8 — Baltra<br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark Silver Galapagos for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.<br />\n  Silver Galapagos will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, frigatebirds, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls. <br />\n  In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin and El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island<br />\n  Genovesa (“Tower “in English) is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a birdwatcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded: a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for storm petrels, a favourite prey. After a morning walk, we will have a chance to enjoy our first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.<br />\n  We will also have the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p>\n<p>Day 3 — North Seymour and Sullivan Bay, Santiago<br />\n  North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife — above and below the sea. Two species of frigatebirds nest here; one of which, the Magnificent Frigatebird, is an opportunistic breeder. At any month of the year we may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females. Galapagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. We will walk through this spectacular landscape, and afterwards have an opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark. </p>\n<p>Coming ashore on the east coast of Santiago Island, we will witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. Our landing will be on a white sandy beach or directly onto lava — depending on the conditions. In either case we will see the lava flows that are not much older than a hundred years — dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that supposedly suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava. As the sun heats up the lava during the day, at the time of our visit the temperatures will have you back at the sandy beach and getting ready for snorkelling in due time. While we will look for shelter from the heat at the beach, be aware that animals like beaches, too. Apart from rays, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p>\n<p>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden Islet, Santa Cruz<br />\n  Rabida is a small picturesque island with red rock cliffs and maroon sand. Here we can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galapagos Mockingbirds. Take a walk along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast, while an underwater world teeming with colourful tropical species and vibrant submarine landscapes is equally amazing. After a short but rewarding hike, we will have the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. You can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.<br />\n  Sail to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galapagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles, they make an excellent spot for kayaking as well.</p>\n<p>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristobal<br />\n  The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galapagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the tenacious work of the Galápagos National Park Service park rangers and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. We’ll see these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado.

San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide our way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p>\n<p>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española<br />\n  Don’t miss a chance to swim with sea lions from the gorgeous beach at Gardner Bay. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic beach as the water laps gently in front of you. You may even spy some iguanas on the shore. Further out you can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while a whitetip reef shark naps on the bottom.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p>The Western Islands are home to the only active volcanoes in the archipelago and are known both for their spectacular volcanic landscapes as well as penguin spotting: over 95% of the Galapagos Penguins live in these islands. It’s also the only area to see the endemic Flightless Cormorant. Other key sites include the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Post Office Bay with its human history and Champion Islet with some of the best snorkelling in the archipelago. <br />\n  Expedition Highlights:<br />\n  • See penguins along the rocky shores and watch for the unique species of Flightless Cormorant<br />\n  • Swim with green sea turtles, sea lions and manta rays<br />\n  • Hike through fragrant forests of palo santo “Incense” trees<br />\n  • Encounter the largest colony of marine iguanas and see land iguanas at Cerro Dragon<br />\n  • Visit one of the most volcanically active places on Earth and walk across spectacular lava fields<br />\n  • See wild flamingos (in season) and nesting sea turtles and observe giant tortoises and sea lion colonies<br />\n  • Photograph iconic Pinnacle Rock</p>\n<p>Day 1 — San Cristobal <br />\n  Embark Silver Galapagos for your exciting Silversea Expedition – Western Galápagos.  After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team. <br />\n  During the late afternoon Silver Galapagos will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands. <br />\n  In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.<br />\n  Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago<br />\n  Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galapagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater. </p>\n<p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We’ll walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches.</p>\n<p>At times of year when conditions aren’t ideal at Espumilla, you’ll enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove.  This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays.  You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting native seabirds (like the Brown Noddy) that nest in the cliffs. </p>\n<p>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina<br />\n  Five (originally six) majestic shield volcanoes up to half-a-million years old pierce the arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos. Snorkelling is probably the best (and coldest) in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano (northwest Isabela). Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for an array of seabirds including Flightless Cormorants and penguins.</p>\n<p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the north-eastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant. </p>\n<p>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela<br />\n  A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings us to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galapagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area in a kayak. </p>\n<p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary. (No landings permitted.)</p>\n<p>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana<br />\n  Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when pirates sought shelter in its caves and at a later stage whalers hunted the island for tortoises. Sailors established a rustic mailing system here: a barrel nailed to a pole where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Then take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in an underwater world as colourful as Floreana’s history. </p>\n<p>You'll have an opportunity to get to know the flora and fauna of this island. On the northern coast (between Punta Cormorant and Post Office Bay), a sea lion rockery has developed. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters. </p>\n<p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature. There is so much to explore in Floreana.</p>\n<p>Where in the world can you see an olivine beach, deciduous vegetation and pink flamingos all in one place? Only at Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands. We will learn about the formation of beaches as we land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p>\n<p>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz<br />\n  Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park.  When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.<br />\n  There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.<br />\n  Silver Galapagos will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them. </p>\n<p>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz<br />\n  The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters (similar to sink holes) in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. Here there’s a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galapagos Martins.</p>\n<p>Tortoises in the Galápagos occur in two different morphotypes: dome-shaped and saddlebacked. The smaller saddleback tortoise was hunted virtually to extinction and just a handful of survivors remain. The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p>\n<p>Day 8 — Baltra<br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark Silver Galapagos for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions. Expedition Team members scheduled for this voyage are subject to change or cancellation.</p>\n<p>Please note that according to the Galapagos National Park Rules it is not allowed to use drones or poles for smartphones in the park.</p>\n<p>GEAR UP  <br />\n  Not sure what to wear while on board?

After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.<br />\n  Silver Galapagos will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, frigatebirds, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls. <br />\n  In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin and El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island<br />\n  Genovesa (“Tower “in English) is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a birdwatcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded: a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for storm petrels, a favourite prey. After a morning walk, we will have a chance to enjoy our first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.<br />\n  We will also have the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p>\n<p>Day 3 — North Seymour and Sullivan Bay, Santiago<br />\n  North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife — above and below the sea. Two species of frigatebirds nest here; one of which, the Magnificent Frigatebird, is an opportunistic breeder. At any month of the year we may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females. Galapagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. We will walk through this spectacular landscape, and afterwards have an opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark. </p>\n<p>Coming ashore on the east coast of Santiago Island, we will witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. Our landing will be on a white sandy beach or directly onto lava — depending on the conditions. In either case we will see the lava flows that are not much older than a hundred years — dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that supposedly suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava. As the sun heats up the lava during the day, at the time of our visit the temperatures will have you back at the sandy beach and getting ready for snorkelling in due time. While we will look for shelter from the heat at the beach, be aware that animals like beaches, too. Apart from rays, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p>\n<p>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden Islet, Santa Cruz<br />\n  Rabida is a small picturesque island with red rock cliffs and maroon sand. Here we can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galapagos Mockingbirds. Take a walk along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast, while an underwater world teeming with colourful tropical species and vibrant submarine landscapes is equally amazing. After a short but rewarding hike, we will have the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. You can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.<br />\n  Sail to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galapagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles, they make an excellent spot for kayaking as well.</p>\n<p>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristobal<br />\n  The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galapagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the tenacious work of the Galápagos National Park Service park rangers and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. We’ll see these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.<br />\n  San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galapagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. We may see three species of boobies here: Red-footed, Blue-footed<br />\n  and Nazca, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, we’ll climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide our way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p>\n<p>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española<br />\n  Don’t miss a chance to swim with sea lions from the gorgeous beach at Gardner Bay. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic beach as the water laps gently in front of you. You may even spy some iguanas on the shore. Further out you can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while a whitetip reef shark naps on the bottom. You may wish to experience this from a kayak: paddling through crystal clear waters while marvelling at the natural wonders all around you.<br />\n  In the afternoon, we will visit Punta Suárez at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galapagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies<br />\n  and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December, and has made Española<br />\n  its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galapagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p>\n<p>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz, and Plazas Sur<br />\n  We will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora. The Station is the operative branch of the Charles Darwin Foundation, an organisation established in 1959 to provide conservation counsel to the Ecuadorian government. Its flagship program is the restoration of Galapagos giant tortoises.<br />\n  At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, we will get to see tortoises of both morphotypes: dome-shaped and saddle-backed, as well as young giant tortoises up to 5 years old that are waiting to be returned<br />\n  to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galapagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals such as dogs and cats, but they have had a comeback thanks<br />\n  to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station. Towards the end of the morning, <br />\n  there will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town.<br />\n  South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galapagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cacti, the reddish sesuvium plants, forming a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galapagos sea lions are also around.</p>\n<p>Day 8 — San Cristobal<br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark Silver Galapagos for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p>\n<p>According to the Galapagos National Park Rules it is not allowed to use drones or poles for smartphones in the park.<br />\n</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary. (No landings permitted.)</p>\n<p>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana<br />\n  Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when pirates sought shelter in its caves and at a later stage whalers hunted the island for tortoises. Sailors established a rustic mailing system here: a barrel nailed to a pole where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Then take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in an underwater world as colourful as Floreana’s history. </p>\n<p>You'll have an opportunity to get to know the flora and fauna of this island. On the northern coast (between Punta Cormorant and Post Office Bay), a sea lion rockery has developed. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters. </p>\n<p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature. There is so much to explore in Floreana.</p>\n<p>Where in the world can you see an olivine beach, deciduous vegetation and pink flamingos all in one place? Only at Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands. We will learn about the formation of beaches as we land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p>\n<p>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz<br />\n  Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park.  When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.<br />\n  There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.<br />\n  Silver Galapagos will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them. </p>\n<p>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz<br />\n  The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters (similar to sink holes) in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. Here there’s a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galapagos Martins.</p>\n<p>Tortoises in the Galápagos occur in two different morphotypes: dome-shaped and saddlebacked. The smaller saddleback tortoise was hunted virtually to extinction and just a handful of survivors remain. The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p>\n<p>Day 8 — Baltra<br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark Silver Galapagos for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p>You will visit one of the most unusual islands in the Galápagos on the North Central Route: Genovesa with its collapsed caldera. The island is a birder’s paradise. Española is the most southerly island and one of the richest in terms of wildlife; it is the only nesting place in the world for the Waved Albatross.</p>\n<p>Expedition Highlights:<br />\n  •\tVisit “Bird Island” -home to over 30 bird species<br />\n  •\tClimb Prince Philip’s Steps to see a thriving seabird colony and search for the Galapagos Short-eared Owl<br />\n  •\tObserve sea lion families and the famed giant tortoises and marvel at the fearless behaviour of wildlife<br />\n  •\tAdmire the antics of Red-footed and Blue-footed Boobies<br />\n  •\tHike up the sides of an extinct volcano and hike across lava flows<br />\n  •\tSee the Waved Albatross<br />\n  •\tSwim and snorkel in tranquil, clear waters<br />\n  •\tPhotograph colourful marine iguanas<br />\n  •\tCruise by Zodiac along scenic coastlines<br />\n  •\tLearn about conservation efforts at the “Fausto Llerena Breeding Center”</p>\n<p>Day 1 — Baltra<br />\n  Embark Silver Galapagos and depart on your exciting Silversea Expedition — North Central Galápagos. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.<br />\n  Silver Galapagos will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, frigatebirds, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls. <br />\n  In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin and El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island<br />\n  Genovesa (“Tower “in English) is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a birdwatcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded: a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for storm petrels, a favourite prey. After a morning walk, we will have a chance to enjoy our first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.<br />\n  We will also have the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p>\n<p>Day 3 — North Seymour and Sullivan Bay, Santiago<br />\n  North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife — above and below the sea. Two species of frigatebirds nest here; one of which, the Magnificent Frigatebird, is an opportunistic breeder. At any month of the year we may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females. Galapagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. We will walk through this spectacular landscape, and afterwards have an opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark. </p>\n<p>Coming ashore on the east coast of Santiago Island, we will witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. Our landing will be on a white sandy beach or directly onto lava — depending on the conditions. In either case we will see the lava flows that are not much older than a hundred years — dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that supposedly suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava. As the sun heats up the lava during the day, at the time of our visit the temperatures will have you back at the sandy beach and getting ready for snorkelling in due time. While we will look for shelter from the heat at the beach, be aware that animals like beaches, too. Apart from rays, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p>\n<p>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden Islet, Santa Cruz<br />\n  Rabida is a small picturesque island with red rock cliffs and maroon sand. Here we can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galapagos Mockingbirds. Take a walk along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast, while an underwater world teeming with colourful tropical species and vibrant submarine landscapes is equally amazing. After a short but rewarding hike, we will have the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. You can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.<br />\n  Sail to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galapagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles, they make an excellent spot for kayaking as well.</p>\n<p>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristobal<br />\n  The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galapagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the tenacious work of the Galápagos National Park Service park rangers and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. We’ll see these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.<br />\n  San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galapagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. We may see three species of boobies here: Red-footed, Blue-footed<br />\n  and Nazca, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, we’ll climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide our way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p>\n<p>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española<br />\n  Don’t miss a chance to swim with sea lions from the gorgeous beach at Gardner Bay. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic beach as the water laps gently in front of you. You may even spy some iguanas on the shore. Further out you can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while a whitetip reef shark naps on the bottom. You may wish to experience this from a kayak: paddling through crystal clear waters while marvelling at the natural wonders all around you.<br />\n  In the afternoon, we will visit Punta Suárez at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galapagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies<br />\n  and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December, and has made Española<br />\n  its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galapagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p>\n<p>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz, and Plazas Sur<br />\n  We will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora. The Station is the operative branch of the Charles Darwin Foundation, an organisation established in 1959 to provide conservation counsel to the Ecuadorian government. Its flagship program is the restoration of Galapagos giant tortoises.<br />\n  At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, we will get to see tortoises of both morphotypes: dome-shaped and saddle-backed, as well as young giant tortoises up to 5 years old that are waiting to be returned<br />\n  to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galapagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals such as dogs and cats, but they have had a comeback thanks<br />\n  to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station. Towards the end of the morning, <br />\n  there will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town.<br />\n  South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galapagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cacti, the reddish sesuvium plants, forming a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galapagos sea lions are also around.</p>\n<p>Day 8 — San Cristobal<br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark Silver Galapagos for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p>\n<p>According to the Galapagos National Park Rules it is not allowed to use drones or poles for smartphones in the park.<br />\n</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team. <br />\n  During the late afternoon Silver Galapagos will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands. <br />\n  In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.<br />\n  Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago<br />\n  Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galapagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater. </p>\n<p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We’ll walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches.</p>\n<p>At times of year when conditions aren’t ideal at Espumilla, you’ll enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove.  This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays.  You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting native seabirds (like the Brown Noddy) that nest in the cliffs. </p>\n<p>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina<br />\n  Five (originally six) majestic shield volcanoes up to half-a-million years old pierce the arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos. Snorkelling is probably the best (and coldest) in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano (northwest Isabela). Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for an array of seabirds including Flightless Cormorants and penguins.</p>\n<p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the north-eastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant. </p>\n<p>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela<br />\n  A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings us to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galapagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area in a kayak. </p>\n<p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary. (No landings permitted.)</p>\n<p>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana<br />\n  Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when pirates sought shelter in its caves and at a later stage whalers hunted the island for tortoises. Sailors established a rustic mailing system here: a barrel nailed to a pole where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Then take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in an underwater world as colourful as Floreana’s history. </p>\n<p>You'll have an opportunity to get to know the flora and fauna of this island. On the northern coast (between Punta Cormorant and Post Office Bay), a sea lion rockery has developed. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters. </p>\n<p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature. There is so much to explore in Floreana.</p>\n<p>Where in the world can you see an olivine beach, deciduous vegetation and pink flamingos all in one place? Only at Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands. We will learn about the formation of beaches as we land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p>\n<p>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz<br />\n  Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park.  When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.<br />\n  There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.<br />\n  Silver Galapagos will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them. </p>\n<p>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz<br />\n  The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters (similar to sink holes) in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. Here there’s a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galapagos Martins.</p>\n<p>Tortoises in the Galápagos occur in two different morphotypes: dome-shaped and saddlebacked.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p>You will visit one of the most unusual islands in the Galápagos on the North Central Route: Genovesa with its collapsed caldera. The island is a birder’s paradise. Española is the most southerly island and one of the richest in terms of wildlife; it is the only nesting place in the world for the Waved Albatross.</p>\n<p>Expedition Highlights:<br />\n  •\tVisit “Bird Island” -home to over 30 bird species<br />\n  •\tClimb Prince Philip’s Steps to see a thriving seabird colony and search for the Galapagos Short-eared Owl<br />\n  •\tObserve sea lion families and the famed giant tortoises and marvel at the fearless behaviour of wildlife<br />\n  •\tAdmire the antics of Red-footed and Blue-footed Boobies<br />\n  •\tHike up the sides of an extinct volcano and hike across lava flows<br />\n  •\tSee the Waved Albatross<br />\n  •\tSwim and snorkel in tranquil, clear waters<br />\n  •\tPhotograph colourful marine iguanas<br />\n  •\tCruise by Zodiac along scenic coastlines<br />\n  •\tLearn about conservation efforts at the “Fausto Llerena Breeding Center”</p>\n<p>Day 1 — Baltra<br />\n  Embark Silver Galapagos and depart on your exciting Silversea Expedition — North Central Galápagos. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.<br />\n  Silver Galapagos will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, frigatebirds, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls. <br />\n  In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin and El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island<br />\n  Genovesa (“Tower “in English) is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a birdwatcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded: a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for storm petrels, a favourite prey. After a morning walk, we will have a chance to enjoy our first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.<br />\n  We will also have the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p>\n<p>Day 3 — North Seymour and Sullivan Bay, Santiago<br />\n  North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife — above and below the sea. Two species of frigatebirds nest here; one of which, the Magnificent Frigatebird, is an opportunistic breeder. At any month of the year we may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females. Galapagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. We will walk through this spectacular landscape, and afterwards have an opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark. </p>\n<p>Coming ashore on the east coast of Santiago Island, we will witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. Our landing will be on a white sandy beach or directly onto lava — depending on the conditions. In either case we will see the lava flows that are not much older than a hundred years — dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that supposedly suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava. As the sun heats up the lava during the day, at the time of our visit the temperatures will have you back at the sandy beach and getting ready for snorkelling in due time. While we will look for shelter from the heat at the beach, be aware that animals like beaches, too. Apart from rays, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p>\n<p>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden Islet, Santa Cruz<br />\n  Rabida is a small picturesque island with red rock cliffs and maroon sand. Here we can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galapagos Mockingbirds. Take a walk along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast, while an underwater world teeming with colourful tropical species and vibrant submarine landscapes is equally amazing. After a short but rewarding hike, we will have the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. You can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.<br />\n  Sail to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galapagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles, they make an excellent spot for kayaking as well.</p>\n<p>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristobal<br />\n  The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galapagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the tenacious work of the Galápagos National Park Service park rangers and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. We’ll see these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.<br />\n  San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galapagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. We may see three species of boobies here: Red-footed, Blue-footed<br />\n  and Nazca, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, we’ll climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide our way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p>\n<p>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española<br />\n  Don’t miss a chance to swim with sea lions from the gorgeous beach at Gardner Bay. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic beach as the water laps gently in front of you. You may even spy some iguanas on the shore. Further out you can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while a whitetip reef shark naps on the bottom. You may wish to experience this from a kayak: paddling through crystal clear waters while marvelling at the natural wonders all around you.<br />\n  In the afternoon, we will visit Punta Suárez at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galapagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies<br />\n  and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December, and has made Española<br />\n  its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galapagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p>\n<p>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz, and Plazas Sur<br />\n  We will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora. The Station is the operative branch of the Charles Darwin Foundation, an organisation established in 1959 to provide conservation counsel to the Ecuadorian government. Its flagship program is the restoration of Galapagos giant tortoises.<br />\n  At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, we will get to see tortoises of both morphotypes: dome-shaped and saddle-backed, as well as young giant tortoises up to 5 years old that are waiting to be returned<br />\n  to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galapagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals such as dogs and cats, but they have had a comeback thanks<br />\n  to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station. Towards the end of the morning, <br />\n  there will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town.<br />\n  South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galapagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cacti, the reddish sesuvium plants, forming a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galapagos sea lions are also around.</p>\n<p>Day 8 — San Cristobal<br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark Silver Galapagos for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p>\n<p>According to the Galapagos National Park Rules it is not allowed to use drones or poles for smartphones in the park.<br />\n</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b> </p><p>\t\nEmbark <i>Silver Galapagos</i> for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition.  After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team. </p><p>\nDuring the late afternoon <i>Silver Galapagos</i> will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands. </p><p>\nIn the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.\n</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b>\n</p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater. </p><p> \n\nBeautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove.  This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays.  You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b>\n</p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.\n</p><p>\nThe largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b>\n</p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak. </p><p>\n\nThe tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b>\n</p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world. </p><p>\n\nA sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters. </p><p>\n\nAs you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.\n</p><p>\nAt Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b>\n</p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park.  When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.\n</p><p>\nThere might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.\n</p><p>\n<i>Silver Galapagos</i> will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them. \n\t\n</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b>\n</p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>\n\nIn the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 8 — Baltra</b>\n</p><p>Following breakfast, disembark <i>Silver Galapagos</i> for your return flight from Baltra Airport.\n</p><p>\n<i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.\n</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed\nand Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b>\n</p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach.  Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.\n</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz \nPlazas Sur</b>\n</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i> will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape.

One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its ge
ological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina.

Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island.

Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way.

Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling.

We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a mu
ch broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island.

Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way.

Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your exciting Silversea Western Galápagos Expedition. After settling in and attending a mandatory safety drill we will be setting sail. This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p>During the late afternoon&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will circumnavigate Kicker Rock. We will be looking for frigatebirds, Swallow-tailed Gulls and Nazca Boobies. The geological formation and its impressive height can best be seen from the ship and conditions permitting we will be able to observe one of the most beautiful sunsets of the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In the evening you will enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bartolomé and Playa Espumilla, Santiago</b></p><p>Some of the most spectacular landscapes in the islands come into view. Just off the coast of Santiago, Bartolomé boasts some of the most magnificent landscapes in the islands including the famous Pinnacle Rock, a towering obelisk at the edge of the ocean. Go snorkelling or take a walk along the beach to look for the playful Galápagos Penguin, perched on a rock or zooming underwater.</p><p>Beautiful Espumilla Beach is an important nesting site for the East Pacific green sea turtle. We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling.

We will walk through the arid vegetation zone of the interior where we will see the largest palo santo trees in the Galápagos, the perfect habitat for several species of Darwin’s finches. At times of the year when conditions are not ideal at Espumilla, you will enjoy a visit to Buccaneer’s Cove. This protected cove once served as a safe harbour for pirates as they repaired their ships and replenished their stores. Today, it offers a wealth of water-based activities, including snorkelling with a kaleidoscopic array of tropical fish, whitetip reef sharks, fur seals and even eagle rays. You can embark on a kayak or Zodiac tour and spy some of the beautiful geologic features of the area—red cliffs, natural caves and unique rock formations—while perhaps spotting seabirds like the Brown Noddy that nest in the cliffs.</p><p><b>Day 3 — Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela, and Punta Espinoza, Fernandina</b></p><p>The arid landscape of Isabela, the largest and youngest island in the Galápagos, is pierced by five majestic shield volcanoes. Snorkelling is probably the best although coldest in the islands at Punta Vicente Roca, located at the base of Ecuador Volcano. Half of this volcano collapsed about 100,000 years ago—meaning that visitors now get a spectacular cutaway view of the caldera. Aboard a Zodiac, we will look for Flightless Cormorants and Galapagos Penguins.</p><p>The largest colony of marine iguanas in the Galápagos can be seen sunning on the black lava shores of Punta Espinoza at the northeastern corner of Fernandina. One of the most pristine islands in the world, Fernandina hosts an impressive array of wildlife including sea lions, colourful Sally Lightfoot crabs and the rare endemic Flightless Cormorant.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Caleta Tagus and Bahía Elizabeth, Isabela</b></p><p>A short cruise across the Bolivar Strait brings Silver Galapagos to Tagus Cove on Isabela Island. Yellow Warblers and Galápagos Mockingbirds may escort our hike between palo santo trees and yellow cordias, passing the briny Darwin Lake along the way. Join the snorkelling tour to look for penguins, cormorants and the shy Brown Noddy along the sheltered cliffs. You may also explore the area on a kayak.&nbsp;</p><p>The tallest red mangrove trees in the Galápagos are found in Elizabeth Bay, an idyllic mangrove lagoon and a fascinating place to observe marine life. We will take a Zodiac through the mangroves where sea turtles swim close to the surface, and pelicans and herons stalk for fish or crab. Sea lions and penguins are also prevalent in this marine sanctuary.</p><p><b>Day 5 — Post Office Bay and Punta Cormorant or Champion, Floreana</b></p><p>Floreana has been luring visitors since the 18th century when whalers hunted the island for tortoises and pirates sought shelter in its caves. Sailors established a rustic mailing system still in use today: a box –today a barrel nailed to a pole- where they would drop letters hoping they would be delivered by other mariners sailing home. You can continue the tradition if you choose. Afterwards take a walk along the lovely beach, or go snorkelling in a colourful underwater world.</p><p>A sea lion rookery has developed on Floreana’s northern shore. Amid lava rocks that are dotted with prickly pear cacti and sesuvium, a small colony of the creatures thrives. Pups are particularly curious when visitors arrive—they love to go in the water and investigate Zodiacs as they pass through their waters.</p><p>As you travel along the coast, you may find many other creatures that look for shelter amid the red and white mangroves: eagle rays, marine turtles, Brown Pelicans and resting Cattle Egrets. Kayaking through the turquoise waters here is a true pleasure, inviting a sense of peaceful solitude and an invigorating feeling of connection to nature.</p><p>At Punta Cormorant, one of the most interesting sites in the islands, we will land on the olive-green sand and walk to Flour Beach, a favourite nesting site for green sea turtles, hoping to see flamingos on the way. Floreana also offers some of the best snorkelling sites in the Galápagos.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Cerro Dragón and Las Bachas, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Cerro Dragon’s land iguanas have played an important part in the conservation program by the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galapagos National Park. When their numbers declined in the 1970s some animals were taken to breed in captivity, others were put onto the neighbouring islet Venecia. As these programs were successful, we will be heading inland on a trail leading past small saltwater lagoons that periodically feature flamingos to see the reintroduced animals. Once at the hill, we will circle Cerro Dragon, looking for the land iguanas and their burrows.</p><p>There might also be the possibility to snorkel near the landing site if time and tides permit.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will relocate to the northern shore of Santa Cruz during the early afternoon. At Las Bachas there will be the chance to swim from one of the two beaches, see White-cheeked Pintails and flamingos at a lagoon behind the beach and look for sea turtles -Las Bachas is one of the major nesting sites for them.</p><p><b>Day 7 — Los Gemelos, Puerto Ayora and the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>The second largest island in the archipelago is home to both the largest human settlement and the second largest wild tortoise population. We will visit Los Gemelos, two pit craters in the midst of a forest of tall scalesia trees that look like giant daisies and are endemic to the Galápagos. There is a good chance to spot land birds, especially one of the rare and endemic Galápagos Martins.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center gives us the opportunity to see both the domed tortoise and the iconic saddleback tortoise after which the islands were named.</p><p><b>Day 8 — Baltra</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from Baltra Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Baltra</b></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea North Central Galápagos Expedition. After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and conditions.

After settling in, attending a mandatory safety drill and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.</p><p><i>Silver Galapagos&nbsp;</i>will then head for Daphne to do a circumnavigation –usually only scientist are allowed to land. From the ship we will watch for Nazca and Blue-footed Boobies, Red-billed Tropicbirds, Brown Noddies and Brown Pelicans, as well as Swallow-tailed Gulls and frigatebirds.</p><p>In the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p><p><b>Day 2 — Bahía Darwin, Genovesa Island</b></p><p><b>El Barranco, Prince Philip Steps, Genovesa Island</b></p><p>Genovesa is dubbed “Bird Island”, a name it lives up to in a spectacular way. Huge colonies of seabirds create a bird-watcher’s paradise. Take a walk on the sandy beach of Darwin Bay, home to one of the world’s largest Red-footed Booby nesting colonies. Yellow-crowned Night Herons feed near tidal lagoons, while hundreds of Swallow-tailed Gulls nest in the cliffs. Climb “Prince Philip’s Steps”, a steep path named after the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the island in 1965, and you will be well rewarded with a remarkable spectacle of Nazca Boobies nesting on the ground, Great Frigatebirds with their fiery red sacs, and, if you are lucky, you might even see the elusive Short-eared Owl on a daytime hunt for Storm Petrels, a favourite prey.</p><p>After a morning walk, you will have a chance to enjoy the first snorkelling excursion and experience the diverse, underwater wonderland that surrounds the island.</p><p>There will also be the opportunity to kayak around Darwin Bay — which is actually a flooded caldera —and admire the island’s craggy landscape.</p><p><b>Day 3 — North Seymour</b></p><p><b>Sullivan Bay, Santiago</b></p><p>North Seymour is a small up-lifted island close to Baltra filled with a spectacular profusion of wildlife above and below the water’s surface. The Magnificent Frigatebird is an opportunistic breeder and at any month of the year one may see males displaying their bright-red gular pouch to attract females.</p><p>Galápagos sea lions snooze in the sand. Blue-footed Boobies perform their courtship dance called “sky-pointing”. Marine iguanas and Galapagos land iguanas patrol the beach, while Brown Pelicans and Brown Noddies look for food in the shallow coastal waters. Walk through this spectacular landscape and afterwards take the opportunity to go snorkelling—perhaps even spotting the impressive whitetip reef shark.</p><p>Witness the marks Nature has left on the islands through its geological forces. At Sullivan Bay we will see lava flows dating back to 1897. Here the very high temperature of the molten material, as well as its gas content, had caused the surface to be quite smooth. The appearance this lava has is almost like frail rope and the technical term for it is pahoehoe (a Hawaiian name that suggests the swirls left behind by a paddle (hoe) in the water). Since the lava has not moved equally in all places, the design of the surface texture induces one to see different objects and images in the lava.</p><p>Back at the sandy beach you might want to get ready for snorkelling. Apart from rays in the shallows, turtles are quite fond of the beaches and come there to lay their eggs.</p><p><b>Day 4 — Rabida and Eden, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>Rabida is a small picturesque island with red cliffs and maroon-coloured sand. Here one can see Darwin’s finches, lava lizards and Galápagos Mockingbirds. A short but rewarding hike will lead along the cliffs where the red rocks, green Palo Santo trees and the blue turquoise sea create landscapes of stunning contrast. The underwater world teems with colourful tropical species and the vibrant submarine landscape is equally amazing. There will be the opportunity to swim or simply stroll along the beach and admire the sea lions snoozing along the shore. One can also go for a stunning snorkel-excursion with sea lions, reef sharks, marine iguanas, colourful anemones and parrotfish, or kayak along the picturesque Rabida cliffs.</p><p><b>Eden Islet</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;sails to Eden Islet for snorkelling, kayaking and Zodiac rides. Eden is a small, eroded tuff cone and an excellent example of the unique geology of the Galápagos. It is home to Great Blue Herons, sea lions, and Blue-footed Boobies; while the small tidal areas can be a resting place for reef sharks, eagle rays and green turtles. Eden is also an excellent spot for kayaking.</p><p><b>Day 5 — La Galapaguera &amp; Punta Pitt, San Cristóbal</b></p><p>The most emblematic animal in the archipelago is the Galápagos giant tortoise. Over-hunting and competition with introduced animals has left its numbers close to extinction. Nonetheless, since the late 1950s, the work of the Galápagos National Park Service and the scientists of the Charles Darwin Research Station has been bringing those numbers back. See these ancient reptiles and their babies, and learn more about current conservation efforts at Galapaguera Cerro Colorado. Breeding and rearing endemic animals in captivity is part of a much broader conservation programme aimed at restoring and protecting the Galapagos Islands’ natural biodiversity.</p><p>San Cristóbal is one of the oldest islands in Galápagos and the well-eroded landscape of Punta Pitt creates a dramatic landscape. Three species of boobies can be found there: Red-footed, Blue-footed and Nazca Booby, as well as both the Great and Magnificent Frigatebird. After a wet landing on an olivine beach where sea lions doze, climb up a ravine to view one of the most scenic panoramas in the archipelago. San Cristóbal or Chatham lava lizards guide the way, while Red-footed Boobies and Nazca Boobies fly overhead.</p><p><b>Day 6 — Bahía Gardner and Punta Suárez, Española</b></p><p>Bahia Gardner promises a chance to swim with sea lions from its gorgeous beach. Relax on the white sands of this idyllic location. Further out one can snorkel with large schools of colourful tropical fish and an occasional manta ray, while whitetip reef sharks may nap on the bottom. Paddling through crystal-clear waters in a kayak, marvelling at the natural wonders, will give another view of the islands’ treasures.</p><p>Punta Suárez is at the western point of Española, the oldest island in the Galápagos. Sheer cliffs provide superb thermals for seabirds. Swallow-tailed Gulls, Nazca Boobies and Blue-footed Boobies can easily be seen. The largest seabird to nest in the islands, the Waved Albatross, may be seen seasonally from April through December and has made Española its home. Mockingbirds, doves, and occasional Galápagos Hawks can also be found, as well as sea lions and colourful marine iguanas.</p><p><b>Day 7 — The Fausto Llerena Breeding Center and Puerto Ayora Town Visit, Santa Cruz Plazas Sur</b></p><p><i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;will cruise overnight to Santa Cruz, an island in the central part of the archipelago with the largest human population. The headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station are located in the small town of Puerto Ayora.</p><p>At the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center, young giant tortoises –both dome-shaped and saddle-backed- up to 5 years old are waiting to be returned to their home island. There is also an exhibit on Galápagos land iguanas; their numbers were once diminished due to introduced animals, but they have had a comeback thanks to the efforts of the National Park Service and Research Station.</p><p>There will be time to do some sightseeing and shopping in town as well.</p><p>South Plaza is a neat little island located close to the eastern coast of Santa Cruz. Its main attraction is a colony of Galápagos land iguanas, but the setting is also a highlight — giant prickly pear cactus, the reddish sesuvium plant, a mat-like ground cover, and a large nesting colony of Swallow-tailed Gulls make this small island an excellent stop. Marine iguanas and Galápagos sea lions are also around.</p><p><b>Day 8 — San Cristobal</b></p><p>Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Galapagos</i>&nbsp;for your return flight from San Cristobal Airport.</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

This afternoon,  you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and attend a safety briefing.  Tonight we invite you to familiarize yourself with your new home away from  home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable  meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day&nbsp;2 — Ngulu  Atoll, Yap, Federated States of Micronesia</strong> <br />\n  Ngulu Atoll is the westernmost island of  the Federated States of Micronesian and we will be welcomed by the few  inhabitants of the island who rarely receive visitors. Snorkel or dive into the  natural lagoon filled with tropical fish like the iridescent blue green reef chromis.  Noddies and terns will be seen on the beach, while frigatebirds patrol the air,  looking for unsuspecting boobies and their catch.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 3 — Colonia, Yap  Island, Yap, Federated States of Micronesia</strong> <br />\n  Although Yap has been under the control  of Spanish, Germans, Japanese and US Americans, the indigenous cultures and  traditions are still strong compared to other states in Micronesia. <br />\n  Yap is best known for its stone money,  known as Rai. These large doughnut-shaped, carved disks vary between 3.5  centimetres (.4 in) and up to 4 m (12 ft.) in diameter. Their value is based on  both the stone’s size and its history, due to the difficulty and hazards  involved in obtaining them. To quarry the stones, Yapese adventurers had to  sail to distant islands and deal with local inhabitants who were sometimes  hostile. As no more disks are being produced or imported, this money supply is  fixed. The islanders know who owns which piece but do not necessarily move them  when ownership changes -as their size and weight (the largest ones require 20  adult men to carry) can make them very difficult to move around. <br />\n  We will explore Yap Island and learn  more about the culture and traditions going to different villages and seeing  the well-kept remains of men’s houses, pathways across the island, and stone  money ‘banks’. That Yap played a part during World War II can be seen through  various wrecks and remains of Japanese and American planes.<br />\n  For those wanting to see mangroves  close-up, the option of kayaking along part of the shoreline will be of  interest (tide-depending). You can see White Terns sitting on branches as you  paddle by and might even sight fruit bats. Hikers will take the option of going  into the lush forest or climbing a nearby hill.<br />\n  The waters around the island are  well-known for the manta rays that not only frequent Yap, but live in Yap’s  waters year-round. Divers will want to take the opportunity to be around these  impressive filter feeders. Yap created the  world's first government-backed manta ray sanctuary. This is believed to be the  reason for a booming reef shark population as well.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Days 4 &amp; 5 — At  Sea</strong> <br />\n  While we cruise  through the southern part of the North Pacific, use the days at sea to learn  more about the lesser known countries of the South Sea. Take advantage of the  luxurious amenities aboard&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer</em> and help our birders spot some of the seabirds found far away from their  nesting grounds. Enjoy lectures preparing you for Melanesia in general and  specifically Papua New Guinea. </p>\n<p>Be aware that King  Neptune might want to pay a visit, as we will cross the Equator on our approach  to Papua New Guinea.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Vanimo, Papua  New Guinea</strong> <br />\n  Vanimo will be our port of entry into  Papua New Guinea. Since visitors are quite rare in this part of the country we  will be the main attraction in town. After being greeted ashore we will drive  to a local venue for some traditional dances and to see some of the handicraft  produced in Sandaun Province. Afterwards we will drive to a local beach for  some refreshing swim, or a walk along the beach to the next little village. To  reach the village a stream might have to be crossed -which at high tide  involves balancing across a single-trunk ‘bridge’.<br />\n  We will return around noon, and <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will continue along  the north coast of Papua New Guinea after lunch. Our lecturers will use the  afternoon to give you more insight into this country of more than 800  languages.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 7 — Murik Lakes  and Kopar Village, Papua New Guinea</strong> <br />\n  During the morning, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be in front of the Murik Lakes -a mangrove  swamp area of the Sepik Province. The ship has to stay quite a distance  offshore as the waters are very shallow. We will take our Zodiacs to reach Karau  Village. Here we will be greeted with a “<em>sing  sing</em>”, an event where several dance groups will act, sing and dance  simultaneously. This is a true delight for photographers as the traditional  dance costumes and body decorations are some of the most colourful of the  northern coast of Papua New Guinea. Apart from the many carvings we will find  here, the Murik people are weavers of the Sepik basket, popular in all parts of  Papua New Guinea. The livelihood of the people here is centred on what they  forage from the mangroves and we might see them harvest crabs and shells or at  least see the produce offered at the impromptu market next to the dance ground.  The village has two men’s houses, but access might be restricted. <br />\n  Later in the day we will visit Kopar, a  small village of not more than 200 people at the mouth of the Sepik River. Depending  on the tide and currents <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> might enter the Sepik River to anchor in front of this little  village. Same as the Murik Lakes people, the people of the Sepik are known for  their artefacts and Kopar presents another opportunity for souvenir hunters.  For the keen birders, a Zodiac cruise along the shore of the Sepik or into the  small canals (or ‘barets’ in pidgin) just upstream from Kopar village can be  rewarded with sights of flood plain birds and parrots and the odd kite.<br />\n  During our visit we will present school  supplies to the local community. Your donations will be very welcome -see below  under “360 DEGREES OF GIVING”.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 8 — Madang, Papua  New Guinea</strong> <br />\n  Madang has one of the South Pacific’s  most beautiful harbours, with a backdrop of steep mountains and lush tropical  vegetation. The town of Madang was the centre of heavy fighting during World  War II, and for our divers there are 34 sunken ships to explore at Hansa Bay.<br />\n  The small town began its “modern life”  as a result of the lucrative copra (dried coconut meat) trade. You will smell  copra in the harbour, as it still is one of the major export articles. <br />\n  During today’s tour, we will see the  Coastwatcher’s Memorial Lighthouse, which was dedicated in 1959 to the Allied  Forces and local civilians who served against the Japanese in WWII.&nbsp;We  will also visit Bilbil Village, famous for its pottery, where our welcome by  traditionally clad villagers performing local dances accompanied by drums is sure  to delight. Keep an eye out for flying foxes that hang in the trees during the  day, but fly off to feed in the evenings —there are many of them in town.<br />\n  Apart from seeing Madang ashore we will  also offer a Zodiac cruise along the shores of the different islands in Hansa  Bay. Although most of the islands are settled the mangroves here are in  excellent conditions. The water, mangroves, beaches and mountains in the  background provide one of the best settings for an outstanding Zodiac cruise.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 9 — Tami Island,  Papua New Guinea</strong> <br />\n  The Tami Islands are a small archipelago  (just four islands) located south of Finschhafen in the Huon Gulf.  Collectively, they are part of Morobe Province. The main island is eponymously  named and is one of just two islands in the enclave to be inhabited. The people  here are known for their elaborately carved, oblong-shaped “Tami bowls”. The  small community of islanders live simply. Tami has just a single primary school  and a small medical aid post.&nbsp; The “sing-sing” here is loud and punctuated  by the beating of ‘kundus’ (hand-held hollowed wooden drums with monitor lizard  skin at one end).</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 10 — Tufi, Papua  New Guinea<br />\n  </strong>Tufi, located on the southeastern peninsula of Cape  Nelson, in Oro Province, is situated on a tropical fjord (the work of ancient  volcanic activities) and surrounded by uncharted coral reefs. During  traditional ceremonies natives wear tapa cloth, which is made from the bark of  mulberry trees found in the local forest. Of course, dance figures  predominantly in the culture, with performers sporting headdresses decked with  bird of paradise plumes and other colourful feathers.<br />\n  <br />\n  Upon arrival, we will canoe along the smooth waters of the Kwapurina Fjord.  With local villagers as our oarsmen
, we will be guided under canopies of  ancient mangrove forests, which are home to Tufi’s wide range of colourful  birds and butterflies. Continuing on our journey, we return to the entrance of  the fjord and the small settlement where the villagers will welcome us with traditional  dance and song. There will also be an opportunity to observe the making of tapa  cloth and to make souvenir purchases.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 11 — Fergusson Island and Dobu, Papua New Guinea<br />\n  </strong>Fergusson is one of the three biggest and mountainous islands in the Milne  Bay Province. The other two islands are Normanby and Goodenough. Together, they  form the D’Entrecasteaux Islands, which are famous for the Dei Dei  geysers—natural hot springs that periodically “erupt” with vapour steam. The  proud villagers will welcome us and accompany us to the hot springs, where they  will tell ancestral tales and legends about this natural display of power.<br />\n  <br />\n  If conditions permit, we will also visit Dobu Island, which is one of the  smaller islands of the D’Entrecasteaux archipelago. Although small in size, the  island played and plays an important role in the Kula Ring. If we go ashore, we  will hopefully get to see some of the objects used in the Kula trade. Neighbouring  islands feared the Dobu Islanders because they were believed to be great  sorcerers.<br />\n  <br />\n  Birdwatchers are in for a treat whilst visiting the D’Entrecasteaux Islands. We  will look out for Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, parrots and Yellow-billed  Kingfisher and—if we are very lucky—we may even spot a bird of paradise.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Bodulan,  Laughlan Islands, Papua New Guinea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  Although in the far east of Milne Bay Province, the nine Laughlan Islands  –basically an atoll open to the west- still form part of the Kula ring. <br />\n  Going ashore on Bodulan (Bodaluna or Budelun according to local versions),  the only inhabited island of this small group, we will stroll through the  village of palm-thatched huts and houses. The Laughlan Islanders are known for  their traditional canoes used in trading –both as vehicles to do the trade as  well as trading objects themselves.<br />\n  Apart from meeting the inhabitants of the island, and looking for  White-breasted Fruit-Doves, Collared Kingfisher, Island Monarchs and Coconut  Lorikeets, the beaches, sandbars and reefs invite to be explored.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 — Njari Island,  Solomon Islands</strong> <br />\n  Gizo is the hub around in which the  Western Province revolves and we will clear into the Solomon Islands near Gizo,  to be able to enjoy Njari Island and its fascinating underwater world.<br />\n  Located just north of Gizo, Njari has  one of the highest counts of fish and coral varieties in the Indo-Pacific –and  we will snorkel and dive to make the most of this small hidden gem. <br />\n  This evening our Captain will invite you  to the Captain’s Farewell Cocktail, while the Executive Chef and Restaurant  Manager will expect you for the Captain’s Farewell Dinner.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 14 — Pavuvu,  Russel Islands, Solomon Islands</strong> <br />\n  Close to Guadalcanal, the Russel Islands  were used by the American forces (Marines) during World War II to prepare for  battles much further east (Peleliu and Okinawa), but little remains of their  time.<br />\n  The islands, of which Pavuvu is the  largest, were and are used to produce copra (the dried meat of coconuts) and  extensive plantations can be seen.<br />\n  In the water our snorkelers and divers  will look for tropical fish in the reef. <br />\n  Since there is a community of Tikopians  living on Pavuvu we might see both Melanesian and Polynesian artistic  expressions while we witness some folkloric activities.<br />\n  Our onboard Photographer/Videographer  will present the Voyage-DVD, permitting you to relive the many moments of  encounters with the local communities, the excursions taken and the animals and  plants seen above and in the water.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 15 — Honiara,  Solomon Islands</strong> <br />\n  Following breakfast,  disembark&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer.</em></p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights  and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be  guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure  opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into  account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity. Expedition Team members  scheduled for this voyage are subject to change or cancellation.</em></p>\n<p><strong>360 DEGREES OF GIVING</strong> <br />\n  They say it’s better to give than to  receive, luckily we have the opportunity to do both. The friendly villagers we  visit throughout our expedition welcome us with such warm hearts, and we  receive so much from them, that we want to make sure we’re giving right back.<br />\n  In the spirit of goodwill, we greatly  encourage you to help us support the local communities we will be visiting.  Gifts may consist of second-hand children’s clothing, school supplies (pencils,  pens, and writing tablets), and medical supplies (Band-Aids, antiseptic wipes,  and first aid items). Supplies received will be collected on board by the  Expedition Team and evenly distributed throughout the villages as we visit.<br />\n  <strong>ARE YOU A CERTIFIED  DIVER?</strong> <br />\n  This Silversea voyage features an  optional Dive Programme that visits several different dive sites throughout the  itinerary. If you wish to participate in scuba diving excursions, here’s what  you need to know.<br />\n  <strong>You must:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Be an advanced scuba diver.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Be fully certified.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Provide proof before embarking the Silver  Discoverer.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Have medical dive travel insurance.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Bring your own gear like Scuba BCDs and  regulators (we will provide weight belts and tanks).&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Snorkelling is available for non-divers.

Tonight we invite you to  familiarize yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your  fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The  Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day&nbsp;2 — Lumalihe Island, Marovo Lagoon, Solomon  Islands</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Marovo Lagoon has  been described by American author James A. Michener as “one of the seven  natural wonders of the world”, Marovo is home to a double barrier reef system, and  is one of two sites in the Solomon’s currently under consideration for UNESCO  World Heritage Site status.<br />\n  Though residents of  Marovo Lagoon normally do not dance, we hope to see some demonstration of local  handicraft, and hear some of their songs.<br />\n  Diving or snorkelling  close to the entrance of the lagoon will expose incredible reef drop-offs that  are characterised by gorgonian fan forests, black coral gardens, giant clams,  sea turtles, manta rays, eels, barracuda, octopus, morays, grey whaler sharks  (also known as grey reef sharks), lionfish and shoals of pelagic fish. <br />\n  Meanwhile,  bird-watchers can look for Osprey, Brahminy Kite and kingfisher in the forests  on one of the many surrounding islands.<br />\n  The Marovo Lagoon  residents are quite famous for their woodcarvings and we hope to see some of  the intricately carved and adorned artefacts –hoping to be able to buy some as  well.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 3 — Roderick Bay, Solomon Islands</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Be out on deck in the  early morning as we approach the Sandfly Passage to reach Roderick Bay, located&nbsp;between Mbokonimbeti Island and Nggela Sule (in the  Florida Islands). <br />\n  Once we reach the bay,  you will see that huge trees give shade and a picture-perfect little beach will  invite you to swim and snorkel, while the extensive coral reef ecosystems,  teeming tropical fish and exceptional dive sites beckon our divers as well. The  snorkelling might show feather stars and colourful nudibranches, vase sponges  and gorgonian fans, lionfish and octopus -all part of this truly remarkable  marine environment.<br />\n  If conditions permit,  our Galley Team will want to offer a barbecue ashore.<br />\n</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Port Mary, Santa Ana, Solomon Islands</strong><br />\n  Today <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will enter Port Mary,  the bay in front of Ghupuna, Santa Ana’s main village. We will have a short  Zodiac ride onto a beautiful white sand beach with huge shade-giving trees.  Once ashore you will notice the very tidy village with its houses made of local  materials built on stilts. <br />\n  After a short welcome  on the beach we will head to the sports ground where we will be entertained by  traditional songs and dances by members of the three different villages on  Santa Ana (Owaraha in the local language). <br />\n  Islanders will have  set up several stands with souvenirs, ranging from traditional shell money to  fishing floats and different carvings based on local stories and legends. <br />\n  In the afternoon, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will continue  eastward. Let our lecturers introduce you to our next destination. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Nembao Village, Utupua Island, Solomon Islands</strong><br />\n  This morning, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will enter the deep  bay on Utupua’s western side. Nembao, one of the main villages on the island,  will be our host this day. After a Zodiac ride, we will land on the sandy beach  next to the village’s centre.<br />\n  We will be welcomed  and attend a presentation of traditional dances and songs. <br />\n  A good way to have a  look at how these Solomon Islanders live is to walk along the beach and look at  the houses, fishing canoes and small plantations.&nbsp; If tide and time permits we might take our  Zodiacs to explore the mangrove-lined shores further into the bay looking for  birdlife and mudskippers.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Champagne Beach, Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu</strong><br />\n  During the morning <em>Silver Discoverer </em>will approach Espiritu  Santo, Vanuatu’s largest island. The European name goes back to the early 17th  century when Pedro de Quiroz believed to have reached the famous “Tierra  Australis Incognita”, the unknown southern land, which he called “La Austrialia  del Espiritu Santo”.<br />\n  We will pass Big Bay,  where the Spaniards tried to settle, to reach Hog Harbor and Champagne Beach.  Once we will have cleared into Vanuatu, you will be able to enjoy one of the  finest beaches of Vanuatu. You can relax under huge Barringtonia trees and Alexandrian  laurel giving cooling shade or swim and snorkel in the crystal-clear water. <br />\n  We hope to see and  hear one of the most unusual music groups of Vanuatu –the Water Music Women.  Standing in a half-circle in the water, they produce their music using the  hands, moving them through the water in different ways.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 7 — Ambrym, Vanuatu</strong><br />\n  In the early morning <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be in front of  Ambrym’s west coast. Unlike Espiritu Santo with its raised coral reefs and  white sand, Ambrym is a volcanic and active (!) island with dark beaches. <br />\n  Ambrym is known as  the island of magic and of the 113 local language of Vanuatu 5 alone are spoken  on Ambrym –apart from Bislama, one of the three official languages of the  country. <br />\n  We will go ashore in  Ranon to have a look at the local community and see the very special Rom dance.  Normally these dances are only shown during grade-taking ceremonies or men’s  secret society meetings and on those occasions the participants actually  prepare their masks and costumes in secrecy.<br />\n  Apart from the  mesmerizing Rom dance we will be entertained by one of the local string bands  and hope to see some of Vanuatu’s sand drawings. Although some might simply see  them as aesthetically pleasing drawings, UNESCO has recognised them as a local  “writing” system and inscribed them on the Representative List of Intangible  Cultural Heritage of Humanity.<br />\n  Our onboard Photographer/Videographer  will present the Voyage-DVD, permitting you to relive the many moments of  encounters with the local communities, the excursions taken and the animals and  plants seen above and in the water.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 8 — Port Vila,  Vanuatu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> <br />\n  Following breakfast,  disembark&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer.</em><br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <em>Expedition highlights  and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be  guaranteed.

This afternoon, you will be introduced  to your Expedition Team and attend a safety briefing. Tonight we invite you to  familiarize yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your  fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day&nbsp;2  — Aniwa and Tanna, Vanuatu</strong></p>\n<p>Our first  stop of the voyage will be in front of Aniwa. Aniwa is a small uplifted coral  platform in the southernmost province of Vanuatu. Here we will want to swim,  snorkel and dive over a reef that formed very recently after a volcanic  eruption with tongues of lava flowing into the ocean. As soon as your head is  touching the water you can see the beauty of the underwater world. </p>\n<p>This reef is  really unique because it is growing on top of a lava flow. You will discover a  big variety of corals in countless colours. From Moorish idols to whitetip reef  sharks you will also find a great variety of fish.<br />\n  <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will then  reposition to Tanna Island, where we will take to the Zodiacs to go ashore in&nbsp;Waisisi. Our first activity in the afternoon will be a visit of the  village and their people. We will be welcomed with a dancing ceremony by both  men and women, before we actually get to walk to and through their village. </p>\n<p>Then the volcano expedition will  start. We will get onto off-road vehicles and drive through lush forests up to  Mount Yasur. Mount Yasur is a very active volcano -its activity was first  recorded by Captain James Cook in 1774 and has continued uninterrupted since  then. </p>\n<p>The last part is walking up a trail  up to the rim of the volcano’s crater. It much depends on how active the  volcano is as to how far we are allowed to go. As soon as you reach the top you  can look into the volcanic crater and hear the rumbling of the volcanic  activity. There are two main craters -with volcanic activity in each crater. As  sunset finishes and the darkness progresses the volcanic activity turns into a  breathtaking firework. The ejected lava glows in red and orange colours.</p>\n<p>We will return quite late to <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 —  Makura, Vanuatu</strong></p>\n<p>During the  morning <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will  continue heading north to reach Makura. You can take the morning to recover  from last night’s late return and sleep in, having a leisurely breakfast.<br />\n  Makura is  quite small, but is the peak of an old volcano whose rim remnants are believed  to be neighbouring islands Emae and Mataso. There is a small village on the  north-western part of the island. This is the only place where there are two  sandy beaches. This afternoon we will be looking for sites to snorkel and dive,  while hikers might want to climb to the top of the island.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 4 — Ambrym, Vanuatu</strong><br />\n  In the early  morning <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be in  front of Ambrym’s west coast. Ambrym is a volcanic and active (!) island with  dark beaches. <br />\n  Ambrym is  known as the island of magic and of the 113 local language of Vanuatu 5 alone  are spoken on Ambrym –apart from Bislama, one of the three official languages  of the country. <br />\n  We will go  ashore near the village of Ranon to have a look at the local community and see  the very special Rom dance. Normally these dances are only shown during  grade-taking ceremonies or men’s secret society meetings and on those occasions  the participants actually prepare their masks and costumes in secrecy.<br />\n  Apart from  the mesmerizing Rom dance we will be entertained by one of the local string  bands and hope to see some of Vanuatu’s sand drawings. Although some might  simply see them as aesthetically pleasing drawings, UNESCO has recognised them  as a local “writing” system and inscribed them on the Representative List of  Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 5 —  Cruising the Coral Sea</strong></p>\n<p>While we  cruise through the Coral Sea, use the day at sea to learn more about the Solomon  Islands. Enjoy lectures that provide insight into the anthropological work done  in this area and hear about Oceanic and early European exploration as well as  the more modern history.<br />\n  <br />\n  Take  advantage of the luxurious amenities aboard&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer</em>. Help our birders spot some of the seabirds  found far away from their nesting grounds or look for dolphins and other  cetaceans known to frequent these waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Port Mary, Santa Ana, Solomon  Islands</strong></p>\n<p>Today <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will enter Port Mary,  the bay in front of Ghupuna, Santa Ana’s main village. We will have a short  Zodiac ride onto a beautiful white sand beach with huge shade-giving trees.  Once ashore you will notice the very tidy village with its houses made of local  materials built on stilts. <br />\n  After a short  welcome on the beach we will head to the sports ground where we will be  entertained by traditional songs and dances by members of the three different  villages on Santa Ana (Owaraha in the local language). </p>\n<p>Islanders  will have set up several stands with souvenirs, ranging from traditional shell  money to fishing floats and different carvings based on local stories and  legends. <br />\n  <br />\n  For those  interested in a hike, the local school, located at the centre of the island, can  easily be reached. For those interested in a swim, snorkelling or diving, the  late morning and early afternoon will give you time to enjoy the waters in  front of Ghupuna.</p>\n<p>In the  afternoon <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will  continue eastward. Let our lecturers introduce you to our next destination. <br />\n  .<br />\n  <strong>Day 7 — Roderick Bay, Solomon Islands</strong> </p><p>\n Be out on  deck in the morning as we approach the Sandfly Passage to&nbsp;reach Roderick Bay&nbsp;between Mbokonimbeti Island and Nggela Sule (in the  Florida Islands). <br />\n  Once we reach&nbsp;the bay&nbsp;you will see that huge trees give shade and a picture-perfect little  beach will invite you to swim and snorkel, while the extensive coral reef  ecosystems, teeming tropical fish and exceptional dive sites beckon our divers  as well. The snorkelling might show feather stars and colourful nudibranches,  vase sponges and gorgonian fans, lionfish and octopus -all part of this truly  remarkable marine environment.<br />\n  During the  afternoon <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will  continue westward to reach the Solomon Islands’ Western Province. </p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 8 — Njari  Island, Solomon Islands</strong> </p><p>\nGizo is the  hub around which the Western Province revolves and we will head for the area  north of Gizo, to be able to enjoy Njari Island and its fascinating underwater  world. Njari has one of the highest counts of fish and coral varieties in the  Indo-Pacific –and we will snorkel and dive to make the most of this small  hidden gem. <br />\n  Playful  dolphins sometimes accompany Zodiac on their way between the ship and the snorkelling  area.<br />\n  After our  morning exploration of Njari we will clear out of the Solomon Islands and head  for Papua New Guinea. Our lecturers will start with their topics about Papua  New Guinea.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 9 —  Cruising the </strong><strong>Solomon Sea en route to Rabaul, Papua New Guinea</strong> </p><p>\n Crossing the Solomon Sea to reach New Britain our  lecturers will offer a variety of topics. The Galley Team might want to tempt  you with a cooking demonstration. When not attending a lecture or seminar,  relax at the pool, make use of the Gym or Spa and enjoy the culinary highlights  the Executive Chef has prepared for you.<br />\n  In the  afternoon <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will  enter Blanche Bay and will pass the active volcano Tavurvur and several other  prominent geological features. While <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> approaches Rabaul, stay on the outer decks and enjoy this  exceptional geological highlight.<br />\n  We will clear  into Papua New Guinea and at night will be able to attend a Baining Fire Dance,  one of the most unusual cultural presentations of New Britain and Papua New  Guinea.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day 10 — </strong><strong>Jacquinot Bay, New Britain, Papua New Guinea </strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will sail  along the coast of New Britain, heading for Jacquinot Bay, New Britain.<br />\n  Take a  leisurely approach to today’s activities, perhaps starting with breakfast in  your suite. Attend one of the lectures or seminars offered during the morning or watch New Britain’s coast while we travel westward.<br />\n  In the afternoon we want to  visit Jacquinot Bay to watch a presentation of local dances and to see a  waterfall that comes straight out of a cliff face. Our stay might include a  village walk and some bird-watching.<br />\n  In the evening <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will sail towards the  Huon Peninsula of mainland Papua New Guinea.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>Day  11 — Tami Island, Papua New Guinea</strong></p>\n<p>The Tami Islands form a small archipelago  (just four islands) located south of Finschhafen in the Huon Gulf. Collectively,  they are part of Morobe Province. The main island is eponymously named and is  one of just two islands in the enclave to be inhabited. The people here are  known for their elaborately carved, oblong-shaped “Tami bowls.” The small  community of islanders lives simply. Tami has just a single primary school and  a small medical aid post.&nbsp; The “singsing”  here is loud and punctuated by the beating of ‘kundus’, hand-held hollowed  wooden drums with monitor lizard skin at one end.</p>\n<p>Beaches and reefs should provide a good  starting point for swimming, snorkelling and diving.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12  — Tufi, Papua New Guinea</strong><br />\n  <strong><br />\n  </strong>Tufi is situated  on a tropical fjord (the work of ancient volcanic activities) and surrounded by  uncharted coral reefs. During traditional ceremonies natives wear tapa cloth,  which is made from the bark of mulberry trees found in the local forest. Dance  figures predominantly in the culture, with performers using tapa cloth and sporting  headdresses decked with bird of paradise plumes and other colourful feathers.<br />\n  <br />\n  Upon arrival, we will canoe along the smooth waters of the Kwapurina Fjord.  With local villagers as our oarsmen, we will be guided under canopies of  ancient mangrove forests, which are home to Tufi’s wide range of colourful  birds and butterflies. Continuing on our journey, we return to the entrance of  the fjord and the small settlement where the villagers will welcome us with traditional  dance and song. There will also be an opportunity to observe the making of tapa  cloth and to make souvenir purchases.</p>\n<p>During the afternoon we will enjoy one of the local  beaches nearby to relax, swim, snorkel and dive.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 13 — Fergusson Island and Dobu Island, Papua New Guinea</strong><br />\n  <strong><br />\n  </strong>Fergusson is one  of the three biggest and mountainous islands in the Milne Bay Province. The  other two are Normanby and Goodenough islands. Together, they form the  D’Entrecasteaux Islands, which are famous for the Dei Dei geysers—natural hot  springs that periodically “erupt” with vapour steam. The proud villagers will  welcome us and accompany us to the hot springs, where they will tell ancestral  tales and legends about this natural display of power.<br />\n  <br />\n  In the afternoon, we will also visit Dobu Island, which is one of the smaller  islands of the D’Entrecasteaux archipelago. Although small in size, the island  played and plays an important role in the Kula Ring. We will hopefully get to see some of the objects used in the  Kula trade. Neighbouring islands feared the Dobu Islanders because they were  believed to be great sorcerers.<br />\n  <br />\n  Birdwatchers are in for a treat whilst visiting the D’Entrecasteaux Islands.  Look out for Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, parrots and eagles and—if we are very  lucky—we may even spot a bird of paradise.</p>\n<p>Diving and snorkelling is tide/current dependent,  but with crystal clear water and the visibility of some  30 metres or more. The coral gardens are extremely healthy with a huge  diversity of both hard and soft corals. <br />\n  The seabed normally  is covered with many different species of echinoderms, including the blue  Linckia sea star, feather stars, sea cucumbers, and the odd crown of thorns  star fish conspicuously positioned in a crevice of the reef. Small damsels,  chromis and other reef fish swarm over corals, and some larger fish lurk in the  deeper water on the edge of the reef, including whitetip  reef sharks. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 14  — Samarai Island, Papua New Guinea</strong><br />\n  <strong><br />\n  </strong>Samarai once was  one of the most important towns, ports and trading centres of British New  Guinea. Today Port Moresby and Alotau have taken over from this little island.  Because of the Japanese advance during World War II the Australian Forces  evacuated the island and the Allied Forces then destroyed most of it to prevent  the Japanese from using it. In 2006 the island was declared a National Historical  Heritage Island, and it is hoped to restore some of the buildings and  structures to their former glory.</p>\n<p>Coming to the jetty on Samarai by Zodiac might be  slightly surreal: it will be one the most modernized community we will come  across throughout this voyage. Many people come from neighbouring islands for  the Saturday market (our visit will be on a Tuesday). It is quite surprising to  see how many solidly constructed houses are found on this tiny island and how  densely populated Samarai is while the surrounding islands seem to consist just  of lush tropical forests.</p>\n<p>The final shopping opportunity in the Samarai market  will be quite exceptional. The dark, heavy wooden carvings are ornate and  inlaid with shells and mother of pearl. Just make sure that what you buy is  allowed to enter Australia!</p>\n<p>This evening our Captain will want to invite you to  the Captain’s Farewell c Cocktail and the Executive  Chef and Restaurant Manager will invite you to the Farewell Dinner.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 15  — Cruising the Coral Sea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p>This leisurely day at sea will take us across the Coral Sea. Begin with a stroll around the outer  decks looking for dolphins or  other cetaceans, have a late breakfast and attend one of the day’s lectures that  might feature fascinating tales of Oceanic exploration and perhaps to learn  more about the connections and differences with  life in Australia. Our knowledgeable Lecture Staff members will recap the  different impressions of our voyage.<br />\n  <br />\n  Our onboard Photographer/Videographer will present  the Voyage-DVD, showing all the interesting encounters with Melanesian  cultures, customs and events, as well as the wildlife seen above and below the  surface of the Solomon Sea and Coral  Sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 16  — Cairns, Australia</strong></p>\n<p>Following  breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer.</em></p>\n<p><em>Expedition  highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be  guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure  opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into  account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity. Expedition Team members  scheduled for this voyage are subject to change or cancellation.</em></p>\n<p><strong>360  DEGREES OF GIVING</strong> <br />\n  They say it’s  better to give than to receive, luckily we have the opportunity to do both. The  friendly villagers we visit throughout our expedition welcome us with such warm  hearts, and we receive so much from them, that we want to make sure we’re  giving right back.<br />\n  In the spirit  of goodwill, we greatly encourage you to help us support the local communities  we will be visiting.

Each village  or island visited has a different approach to culture and traditions and we  will be able to see exceptional artistic expressions, be it as paintings,  carvings or weavings. This voyage is sure to be an interesting kaleidoscope of  culture and nature.<br />\n  <br />\n  Highlights:<br />\n  - Be accompanied by a canoe flotilla in the Asmat Region and marvel at the  famous Asmat woodcarvings, immersing yourself in the ancient Asmat culture. <br />\n  - Visit Banda Naira, the original  home of nutmeg<br />\n  - Look for the Komodo Dragons, the  largest living lizard in the world&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  - See the traditional Pasola, a ceremonial fight on horseback in Kodi<br />\n  - See how the famous ikat textiles are made –and purchase some from the  weavers</p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 –  Cairns, Australia</strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Discoverer</em> for  your adventure along the Australian coast into the Asmat Region and to the  Banda Islands, the original home of nutmeg.<br />\n  Once you have settled in, a mandatory safety drill will be conducted  before leaving port. During the afternoon you will have several briefings and  important members of the crew will be introduced to you.<br />\n  In the evening enjoy the first of  many memorable meals in The Restaurant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 – At  sea, cruising the Coral Sea</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> will sail north while you will have time to unwind after your travels  to join the ship. Perhaps you would like to have a leisurely breakfast next to  the Pool or in your suite. Then attend one of the informative lectures, spend  time on deck looking for seabirds or make an appointment in the Spa.<br />\n  In the evening the Captain would like to invite to you the welcome  cocktail party.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 –  Thursday Island, Australia</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> will arrive in the afternoon to have a look at this former pearling  centre at the top of Australia. Just 39 kilometres north of Cape York Thursday  Island has an area of about 3.5 square kilometres. Populated for thousands of  years by the Melanesian Torres Strait Islanders, Thursday Island has a  population of slightly more than 2600.<br />\n  World War 2 arrived in Australia at the top end and for your tour today  you &nbsp;will take a private ferry to Horn  Island and walk in the forgotten footsteps of the indigenous and non-indigenous  soldiers who served in the area to experience an unmatched personal interaction  with your specialist guides. On your journey you visit the original gun emplacements,  an underground command post, slit trenches, a WW2 aircraft wreck with an  unbelievable story, WW2 airstrip, dispersal bays and taxiways and listen to the  eerie sound affects the airstrip provides today. The tour travels on actual WW2  roads and tracks laid down by the military.<br />\n  Apart from WW2 impressions another aspect of Australia’s northernmost  islands will be of interest: local artists will discuss their art and stories  with you as morning tea is served and you visit the Torres Strait Museum before  your ferry returns you to Thursday Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 – At  Sea</strong><br />\n  You can use your time at sea to relax, unwind on the open decks looking  for seabirds or marine mammals, attend a lecture about Papua, or perhaps taste  one of the local delicacies prepared by the Executive Chef and the Galley Team. <br />\n  If you have not had enough exercise, the Gym would be a good choice.  Team Trivia in the Explorer Lounge and a cool drink at the Pool Bar will while  your time away before a briefing will prepare you for the adventure waiting in  the Asmat. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 5-6 –  Asmat Region, Indonesia </strong><br />\n  The Asmat region, an area of lowland swamp and rainforest, has long  sheltered the Asmat tribes from outsiders -and our visit is an expedition  highlight. <br />\n  As we make our way upstream, Asmat villagers—whooping and chanting in  elaborate warrior gear and war paint—paddle vigorously toward us in dozens of  intricately carved canoes. <br />\n  We will be escorted to the village of Syuru, near Agats, the capital of  the Asmat region, where an enthusiastic welcome awaits. Once ashore, we will  walk along elevated wooden boardwalks to a men’s longhouse. You will be invited  to witness a local meeting and ceremony.<br />\n  From the men’s house we will walk to the Catholic Cathedral with its  interesting carvings. Opposite the cathedral is the Asmat Museum -the Asmat  have one of the most renowned and vibrant woodcarving traditions in the  Pacific. Elaborate and superb displays of ancestor poles, drums, body masks,  shields, daggers, and skulls, will remind us that headhunting and cannibalism  were practiced here until the early 1970’s. <br />\n  During our visit Zodiacs will take us through this remote riverine,  cruising along narrow waterways lined with the entwined branches of thick  mangrove forests, home to dozens of species of parrots, lorikeets and other  birds including the spectacular bird of paradise. <br />\n  Asmat culture has remarkable ritual objects based on an intriguing  interpretation of life and death. Asmat woodcarvings are known for their  powerful lines and coarse, expressive motifs, and are widely considered to be  among the world’s finest. We will have the opportunity to purchase carvings  directly from village artisans or at one of the galleries in Agats.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 –  Triton Bay, Indonesia</strong><br />\n  In 2008 the Kaimana Regency declared a 6000 km² Marine Protected Area around  the waters of Triton Bay. Conservation International maintains an office in  Kaimana and a field station out in Triton Bay where visiting scientists can do  their work.&nbsp;The marine biodiversity is second to none&nbsp;and the area  offers everything from the tiniest pygmy seahorses to large and graceful whale  sharks.<br />\n  Triton Bay is one of three regions in Indonesia’s West Papua province  that comprise the Bird’s Head Seascape. This is considered to be the epicentre  of the Coral Triangle, containing more fish and coral species than anywhere  else on the planet. &nbsp;Triton Bay is best known for its beautiful soft coral  gardens as well as having nesting grounds for green turtles, a population of  coastal Bryde’s whales, and whale sharks.<br />\n  We will be looking for a nice beach to relax and hope to be able to swim  and snorkel with whale sharks.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 –  Watubela Island</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> will be in the Watubela Group and during the morning we will be looking  for good swimming and snorkelling sites. Some of the islands have small  communities and we might visit one of the small villages. The raised coral  islands have interesting cliffs and picturesque limestone islets located  offshore.&nbsp; <br />\n  During the afternoon we will be cruising the Banda Sea and our lecturers  will have interesting topics to prepare you for the island of nutmeg.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 – Banda  Neira and Pulau Ai, Indonesia</strong><br />\n  When coming close to the channel separating Banda Neira and its  neighbouring island Gunung Api, have a look at the lava flows on the northern  side of Gunung Api –they are signs of a recent volcanic eruption and the  volcano might still be steaming!<br />\n  We depart the ship for a morning walking tour of the historical and  formerly quite rich city of Banda, the main town and administrative centre of  the Banda Islands – a group of ten small volcanic islands. Several colonial  buildings, the protestant church and the remains of two impressive forts built  by the Dutch, one of which has been restored, are found near the harbour. One  of the forts has been restored and is on UNESCO’s “Tentative List” to become a  World Heritage Site –as are the Banda Islands themselves. Our stops include a  visit to the local market and a tour of the clove and nutmeg plantation -until  the mid-19th century the Banda Islands were the world’s only source of nutmeg.  We will also visit the two forts before returning to <em>Silver Discoverer.</em><br />\n  During lunch the ship repositions a few miles to Pulau Ai, an isolated  low lying island to the west of Banda Neira. It has some small limestone cliffs  on its southern coastline and some pretty beaches on its northern shores.  Remains of an old five-sided fort, Dutch tombstones and graves next to a modern  cemetery can still be seen.<br />\n  Due to its isolation, walls and deep waters, when the current is  running, Pulau Ai is one of the top dive sites in the Banda Islands for shark  encounters. Hammerhead sharks, thresher sharks and silvertip sharks are  occasionally sighted, while wahoo, giant trevally, Bluefin trevally and chevron  barracuda appear in good numbers. Sometimes groups of up to 25 rays are seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 – At  Sea</strong><br />\n  A day at sea always gives good opportunities to assess the things seen  so far and to prepare one for the different islands still to be visited. Enjoy  a lecture about culture and natural history, or perhaps about the more modern  influences on this remote part of the world. Help our birders spot some of the  seabirds found far away from their nesting grounds. A refreshing drink, a visit  to the Spa and the participation of a seminar are other choices.&nbsp; There are many ways to enjoy the day  while&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer</em>&nbsp;cruises the Banda Sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 –  Kalabahi (for Takpala), Alor, Indonesia</strong><br />\n  This morning we arrive at Kalabahi, the capital and port for Alor  Island. Set inside a peaceful bay of white sandy beaches, and overlooked by two  old volcanoes, Kalabahi is our starting point for an excursion into the rugged  interior and to meet the indigenous Abui. <br />\n  We will first have a look at a local market and Kalabahi’s museum, which  houses interesting textile exhibits and drums, before we visit the traditional  hilltop village of Takpala where we are welcomed by the Chief and enjoy a  cultural performance of dancing and chanting. Afterwards you will be able to  have a look at how the Abui live, get to see their homes and how food is  prepared. You might want to taste some of the manioc or the freshly brewed  local coffee. Handicrafts and textiles will be on sale before you return to  Silver Discoverer around noon.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 – Ende,  Flores, Indonesia</strong><br />\n  One of Flores’ attractions is the Kelimutu National Park northeast of  Ende. Landing on the southern side of Flores, we will almost completely circle  the Kelimutu National Park in order to get to Mount Kelimutu, an active  volcano. The site is spectacular, as Mount Kelimutu has three summit crater  lakes, located one next to the other, each with varying colours. The lakes are  even featured on the Indonesian 5,000 Rupiah bill. <strong></strong><br />\n  During the late afternoon be on deck to watch the Lesser Sunda Islands  passing by before you attend the briefing for tomorrow’s activities on Komodo. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 – Komodo  Island, Indonesia</strong><br />\n  Early risers may spot whales as we approach Komodo. <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor close to the National Park  Headquarter, and Zodiacs will bring you ashore onto a floating jetty to reach  the starting point of our hike. Walk along forested pathways in search of  Komodo dragons. These enormous reptiles weigh up to 300 pounds. The surrounding  forest is also home to ornate orchids, elegant Sulphur-crested Cockatoos,  Helmeted Friarbirds, Orange-footed Megapodes, and Javan deer. Each walking  group is accompanied by two local rangers who provide interpretation and help maintain  a safe distance between the dragons and the visitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  During lunch, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will reposition to the spectacular Pink Beach for an afternoon of snorkeling or relaxing  on the beach. You can see shimmering tropical fish such as the striped clown  fish nestled among the protective tentacles of its sea anemone host, or a  spotted grouper lazily swimming by a flamboyant sea fan. In addition to  tropical fish at Pink Beach, rays have regularly been seen close to the  neighbouring island of Pulau Punya.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 –  Kodi, Sumba, Indonesia</strong><br />\n  Known for its intricate <em>ikat</em> fabric, distinctive architecture and sculptured stone tombs, Sumba has resisted  the advances of the modern age. It is therefore a fascinating island to  explore, especially West Sumba where ancient tribal rites are best preserved. <br />\n  The local culture revolves around fortified villages where ancestors are  worshipped by extended families living in enormous clan houses with  high-pitched thatched roofs. The Sumbanese honour the dead by dragging massive  stones a great distance to construct mausoleums for the departed. <br />\n  On our visit to a traditional village, we will witness a welcome  ceremony, as well as a “<em>pasola</em>”, a  fierce martial arts performance on horseback. We will also observe the process  of making Indonesia’s famous <em>ikat</em> textiles, including the opportunity to purchase <em>ikat</em> directly from the weavers.<br />\n  During the afternoon we will have a chance to watch our Photographer/Videographer’s  presentation of the Voyage-DVD, hopefully bringing back fond memories of  different cultures, customs and peoples seen during this spectacular voyage across  Indonesia.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 15 –  Benoa, Bali, Indonesia</strong><br />\n</p><p><strong>GEAR UP</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not sure what to wear while onboard? <a style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http://www.shiptoshoretraveler.com/silversea\">Visit our shop and gear up</a>.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Highlights:</strong><br />\n  - See Mount Merapi and Ijen Crater Lake <br />\n  - Photograph the famous bull races on Madura<br />\n  - See orangutans in the wild and learn about Camp Leakey’s projects  through Dr. Biruté Galdikas <br />\n  - Swim and snorkel in the Badas Islands</p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 – Benoa, Bali, Indonesia</strong><br />\n  Embark Silver Discoverer in Benoa and get ready for your Silversea  Expedition <em>Orangutans and hidden islands  of Indonesia.</em> Once you have settled in, partake in a mandatory safety drill  before several briefings will be done. Important crew members and the  Expedition Team will be introduced to you.<br />\n  Attend the sail way cocktail and savour the first of many memorable  dinners in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 – Tanjung Wangi, Java,  Indonesia</strong><br />\n  Tanjung Wangi is a port slightly north of the Regency’s capital of Banyuwangi  and permits an access to two very different National Parks of Indonesia: just  across the less than 2 mile wide Bali Strait is the West Bali National Park  with dense mangrove forests, dry savannah, and rainforest. <br />\n  The other well-known area close to Banyuwangi is Mount Merapi with the  highly acidic Ijen Crater Lake –the biggest crater lake in Java.&nbsp; One can  drive with four-wheel drives up to the crater, but has to walk the last part to  see it. The 90-minute hike to Ijen Crater starts at the park rangers’ post. The  stunning view of the lake’s eerie turquoise colour, the yellow sulphur deposits  and steam will be unveiled at 2883 meters altitude. <br />\n  Returning from the crater’s rim, we will have lunch at a local  restaurant before we drive back to Tanjung Wangi Port.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 – Sumenep, Madura,  Indonesia</strong><br />\n  Sumenep is located on the eastern side of the island of Madura. Sumenep  and the surrounding areas are home to a number of traditional arts and crafts  –among them the production of Keris (daggers), batik, Karduluk-style woodcarvings  and the Muangsangkal and mask dances.<br />\n  During our visit we will see one of Sumenep’s most outstanding  historical buildings: the Sumenep Great Mosque. Built in 1763 it is one of the  ten oldest mosques in Indonesia and its style is very unusual: it has both a  Chinese and a European influence. Close to the Great Mosque and Adipura Park is  the Museum and Palace of Sumenep. The Palace (Keraton) was built at almost  exactly at the same time as the Great Mosque. <br />\n  Our visit continues with a drive to see the Kerapan Sapi, one of  Madura’s most famous attractions –a bull race. The event opens with the  performance of Saronen, traditional Madurese music. Depending on the level of  competition, the teams of bulls and their jockeys/drivers have to cover a  distance of 120-140 metres. Sometimes actual carriages or carts are raced, on  other occasions sleds of bamboo are used, permitting a higher speed. These  races started as a gesture of gratitude for abundant harvest and are now an  important part of Madurese traditions.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 4 – At Sea</strong><br />\n  On our way to Borneo and Camp Leakey our lecturers will want to prepare  you for the different natural highlights that await you there. Attend a lecture  about Camp Leakey and the continuous efforts by Dr. Biruté Galdikas to save the  orangutan, relax at the pool, or help our Expedition Team looking for wildlife  above and below the water’s surface. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 – Kumai (for Camp Leakey),  Borneo, Indonesia</strong><br />\n  Kumai is located next to one of the most important National Parks of  Borneo and Indonesia –Taman Nasional Tanjung Puting.<br />\n  Tanjung Puting is the largest and most diverse protected example of  extensive coastal tropical heath and peat swamp forest of southern Borneo. Declared  a National Park in 1982, it remains substantially wild and natural. Apart from  orangutan and other primate species found in the park, clouded leopards,  civets, and Malaysian sun bears, mouse deer, barking deer and sambar deer, as  well as wild cattle known as banteng are seen here. But there are also so  called “bird lakes”, seasonal rookeries for several species of endangered waterbirds.<br />\n  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> <br />\n  Depart early morning by Zodiac for an all-day adventure into the Tanjung  Puting National Park and private tour of Camp Leakey. Your escort is Dr. Biruté  Mary Galdikas who founded Camp Leakey in 1971 and named it in honour of her  mentor, Dr. Louis Leakey. At the time, Dr. Leakey selected Jane Goodall to  study chimpanzees in Tanzania, placed Dian Fossey with the mountain gorillas of  Rwanda and encouraged Biruté Mary Galdikas to study the elusive orangutans of Borneo.  Up river, you will make a stop at Pondok Tanggui, an Orangutan feeding station  on the way to Camp Leakey where you will switch to klotoks, the local boat  transportation to view the magnificent scenes that surround you where you will  see Proboscis monkeys, agile gibbons and long-tailed macaques. You may see many  birds of more than 400 species including beautifully coloured rhinoceros  hornbills. Lunch will be provided along the way as you relax under the klotok’s  covered top deck. Upon your arrival to Camp Leakey, you are usually met by some  of the locals… the endangered orangutans that call this sanctuary home. Dr.  Galdikas will lead you through the peat forest easily traversed on raised  wooden walkways to her private areas of the camp, including her home. The  narrative of her 45 years devoted to the study, care and preservation of these  endangered creatures is truly inspiring. Expect to have close-up encounters  with these benevolent apes as she leads you through the facilities and then  onto the dirt paths leading to the feeding station where orangutan mothers and  their offspring show up to partake in their favourite fruits supplied by the  Orangutan Foundation Intl (OFI) staff. Hopefully you will see Tom, the dominant  male, adolescent males and even wild pigs during your visit. You will return to  your ship, arriving early evening to a delectable dinner.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 -Kumai (for Camp Leakey), Indonesia</strong><br />\n  Today we visit Dr. Galdikas’ Orangutan Care  Center &amp; Quarantine (OCCQ) located just a short drive from the pier. This  facility is closed to the public, but under Dr. Biruté’s watchful eye has been  made available exclusively for Silversea guests. You will tour the veterinary centre  where everything from life-saving treatments to routine check-ups takes place.  The entire OFI facilities, here and in various outposts, house more than 300  orphaned, sick or injured orangutans and sun bears. In the wild, orangutan  infants share an intense bond with their mothers and do not leave them until  they are 8 or 9 years old. The caregivers here replicate this bond, to some  extent, with their daily interaction of caring, feeding and playing with these  orphaned babies. You will have the opportunity to observe juveniles at play in  the trees and on their jungle gym with personal encounters not uncommon. Then  visit with the babies, shy at first but becoming braver as you sit among them,  open to their curiosity. The intimate encounters you will experience today will  no doubt stay with you the rest of your life. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 7 – At Sea</strong><br />\n  Use the day at sea to attend further lectures, edit your many  photographs, savour some of the culinary specialties the Executive Chef and his  team have prepared for you and enjoy the vistas of the South China Sea. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 – Badas Islands,  Indonesia</strong><br />\n  The Badas Islands are part of the Tudjuh Archipelago west of Borneo and  belong to the Riau Islands province.<br />\n  More than 12 islands and islets make up the group and depending on wind  and currents we will select a sheltered bay or beach for our water activities. Shipping  lanes are not near and the relative isolation of the islands added to their  hilly structure and rugged coastline has led to only small settlements. There  are a few sandy beaches and fringing reefs and we will look for appropriate  snorkelling and diving sites.<br />\n  In the evening the onboard Photographer/Videographer will present the  Voyage-DVD.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 – Singapore, Singapore</strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver  Discoverer</em>.</p>",

The vast majority of the hundreds of islands are still uninhabited and have only recently opened up for tourism. The traditional inhabitants of these archipelagos are the Salone or Moken, a people who live off, and on, the sea. Sometimes called \"sea-gypsies\", this ethnic minority group leads a traditional, semi-nomadic lifestyle, dominated by diving for sea cucumbers, fishing and bartering.&nbsp;\t<br /><b><br />\nHighlights:\t</b><br /><br />\n- Visit Gunung Leuser National Park to see orangutans in the wild <br />\n- Dive in waters rarely visited<br />\n- Swim, snorkel and relax in the Mergui Archipelago<br />\n- Visit the Moken –the semi-nomadic inhabitants of the Mergui Archipelago<br /><b><br />\n\nDay 1 – Singapore</b><br /><br />\t\nAfter your arrival in Singapore, embark Silver Discoverer during the early afternoon. Once you have settled in, you will attend a mandatory safety drill. After sail-away important crew members and the Expedition Staff will be introduced.<br />\nIn the evening enjoy the first of many memorable culinary highlights in The Restaurant. <br /><br /> \n\n<b>Day 2 – Malacca, Malaysia</b><br /><br />\nToday you will have the opportunity to explore the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Melaka, one of the two remarkable examples of a colonial town on the Straits of Malacca. Malacca’s glorious past is seen through the streets and buildings that are steeped in history illustrating its prosperous trading heritage.  Begin your tour with a photo stop at Porta de Santiago - the only remains of the Dutch fortifications – before seeing The Stadthuys, arguably Malacca’s most photographed building.  Constructed in the mid-1600s it is believed to be the oldest Dutch building in the East and is a fine example of Dutch architecture from that era. Visit the Melaka Sultanate Palace, a replica of the original 15th-century wooden palace, which is now the Cultural Museum.  Proceed on to cross the bridge, which leads you to Malacca’s Chinatown. Walk to the Malacca Babas &amp; Nyonya Museum, typical of the 19th century Baroque style homes of wealthy Chinese families. Continue on to Cheng Hoon Teng Temple, the oldest Chinese temple in Malaysia, and Kampung Kling Mosque.  \nIn the afternoon, attend a lecture and the Recap &amp; Briefing, preparing you for Gunung Leuser National Park and the islands in the Andaman Sea. <br /><br />\n\n<b>Day 3 – Belawan (for Gunung Leuser National Park), Indonesia</b><br /><br />\nSilver Discoverer will go alongside in Belawan, Sumatra’s busiest port. Built originally to export tobacco, rubber and later palm oil, Belawan today is an important port for containers, and exports now include coffee and tea.\nFor us Belawan is the gate to Gunung Leuser National Park. Located in the interior of Sumatra, running along the Barisan mountain-ridge from Aceh towards the southeast, the park covers an area of some 9000 square kilometres –and apart from being one of Indonesia’s oldest (and possibly least visited) parks is part of the UNESCO World Heritage site “Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra”.<br /><br />\nThe park is quite mountainous and home to more than 120 species of mammals, 190 species of reptiles and amphibians, as well as more than 350 species of birds. More than 4000 plant species, including such interesting plants as the corpse flower (Rafflesia arnoldii) and titan arum (Amorphophallus titanium) can be found in the park.<br /><br />\nAt the Bukit Lawang Visitor Center we will be briefed by a ranger to learn about the flora and fauna of the park, and to know more about our visit and hike in the park. The former Bohorok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre had released more than 200 of the Sumatran orangutan back into the wild before it had to close. Apart from Sumatran orangutan there are eight other primate species present in the park. We hope to see several during our forest walk.<br /><b><br />\n\nDay 4 – At Sea</b><br /><br />\nToday Silver Discoverer will sail north, continuing on her way through the Malacca Strait. Make use of the outer decks to watch for Brown Boobies nesting on isolated islands and rocks in the Strait and the Lesser Frigatebirds close by.<br />\nOur Expedition Team will present lectures about the history and natural history of the Mergui Archipelago preparing you for the next four days of exploration within this group of more than 800 islands spread out over 36.000 km². This is a prime location for water activities, and our Marine Biologist will want to talk about Mergui’s underwater residents. Temperatures range between 24° and 32° C for the air and 26°-29°C for the water, making it quite agreeable for swimming, snorkelling and diving.\t<br /><br />\n\n<b>Day 5 – Kawthaung and Myauk Phyu Island, Myanmar</b><br /><br />\nOnce Silver Discoverer has been cleared into Myanmar, we will have a look at this border town formerly known as Victoria Point.  Interestingly enough it has a strong Muslim and Indian influence and a Buddhist monastery atop the hill to the north of the town. The monastery has impressive guardian dragons and will offer nice views of Kawthaung.<br />\nDuring lunch Silver Discoverer will relocate to Myauk Phyu Island. Our first afternoon in the archipelago will be used to explore the beaches and water of the uninhabited Myauk Phyu, right next to Hastings (Za Det Nge in the local language) and the adjacent uninhabited islands.  Long white-sand beaches, clear water and birdsong ashore will captivate nature lovers. Our divers and snorkelers will take up the first opportunity to see corals and colourful fishes, while others might simply relax on the beach, or take a refreshing swim.<br /><br />\t\n\t\n<b>Day 6 – Lampi (Kyun Tan Shey), Mergui Archipelago, Myanmar</b><br /><br />\nDuring our second day in the archipelago we want to take advantage of Kyun Tan Shey (Lampi Island) located in the Lampi Group. The officially uninhabited Lampi, apart from having occasional fishing nomads stop over, is large enough to hold wild animals. With rainforest and a fringing coral reef, Lampi’s outstanding beauty is enhanced by spotting monkeys, hornbills and sea eagles. Lampi was established in 1995 as Myanmar’s first marine national park. It is rich in biodiversity, mangroves and coral reefs. Ashore you can witness some of the area’s exotic flora and fauna. The surrounding islands offer beaches regardless of tides. More than 50 white sand beaches and fringing reefs wait to be used for snorkelling, bird-watching or just relaxing.<br />\nAt this spectacular island we intend a Zodiac cruise and might enter a mangrove area.<br /><br />\t\t\n\n<b>Day 7 – Bo Cho and Frost Island, Mergui Archipelago, Myanmar</b><br /><br />\nLocated south of Lampi Island, Bo Cho Island is a sacred home for the Moken (Sea Gypsy) people who refer to the island with their own name of Pu Nala. A small Moken resettlement zone has been established here and now there is a year-round Moken village. The people are obviously connected to the ocean and many of their houses are built on stilts near the shore where they can keep a watchful island on their boats and the sea. Close to 1000 Moken people have made Bo Cho their home and a basic infrastructure supports them. There will be the chance meeting them and to see their unique boat designs. <br />\nAround noon Silver Discoverer sails south passing Buda Island. In the afternoon we will visit Frost Island, one of the smaller islands in the Mid-Group. Here and at the neighbouring island we find nice beaches that are perfect for relaxation, while in the water we will be looking for hard and soft coral and colourful tropical fishes.<br /><br />\n\n<b>Day 8 – Kyet Mauk Island and Kawthaung, Myanmar</b><br /><br />\nSnorkelling at Kyet Mauk is quite special. The island has no beaches, but at the southern tip of the island is an arch that permits at low tide to swim or snorkel for some 15 metres to get into a lake in the interior of the island. Even if you do not want to venture into the arch, the outside has good visibility and many different kinds of fish can be seen.<br />\nHave a late breakfast while Silver Discoverer then heads back to Kawthaung where the authorities will prepare our outbound clearance.<br />\nLater during the day, our lecturers will entertain you summing up the experiences in Sumatra and the Mergui Archipelago, or might prepare you for the Mu Ko Surin National Park and Phuket.<br />\nIn the afternoon our onboard Videographer will present the voyage-DVD. This will be a good opportunity to review the many interesting and magical moments of the voyage.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Day 9 – Ko Surin Tai, Thailand</b><br /><br />\nThe Ko Surin Tai National Park might be considered an extension of the Mergui Archipelago, but the park and its islands actually belong to Thailand. Created in the 1980s, the park is considered a haven for several animal species and plants. At the edge of the ancient rain forest one might spot monitor lizards, flying foxes and pig-tailed macaques.<br />\nImpressive coral reefs with more than 200 coral species show either large pelagic fish on the exposed west side or a more protected east side with many small bays.<br />\nThe Surin Islands are considered Thailand’s best location if one wants to swim with turtles, as hawksbill, green, leatherback and even the rare olive ridley are often seen.<br />\nWe will visit the southern of the two main islands of this park and will spend the day on the beach, in the water and will make the most of the opportunities for water sports.<br /><br />\n \t\n<b>Day 10 – Phuket, Thailand</b><br /><br />\t\nAfter breakfast, disembark Silver Discoverer.",

After  settling in, you will attend a mandatory safety drill and Zodiac briefing before  leaving port.<br />\n  This evening, you  will be introduced to important members of the crew and the Expedition Team.  Get to know some of your fellow travellers at sail away and enjoy the first of  many memorable dinners in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 – Kawthaung and Myauk Phyu, Mergui Archipelago,  Myanmar</strong><br />\n  Once <em>Silver Discoverer</em> has been cleared into  Myanmar, we will have a look at this border town formerly known as Victoria  Point. Interestingly enough it has a strong Muslim and Indian influence and a  Buddhist monastery atop the hill to the north of the town. The monastery has  impressive guardian dragons and will offer nice views of Kawthaung.<br />\n  More than 800  islands spread out over 36.000 km² make Mergui Archipelago a prime location for  underwater activities and during lunchtime <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> will head out to Myauk Phyu, our first destination for swimming,  snorkeling and diving. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 – Lampi, Mergui Archipelago, Myanmar</strong><br />\n  During our second  day in the archipelago we want to take advantage of Lampi –also known as Kyunn  Tann Shey- the largest island in the Lampi Group. The officially uninhabited  Lampi, apart from having occasional fishing nomads stop over, is large enough  to hold wild animals. With rainforest and a fringing coral reef, Lampi’s  outstanding beauty is enhanced by spotting macaques, hornbills and sea eagles.

More than 50 white sand beaches and fringing reefs wait to be used  for snorkelling, bird-watching or just relaxing.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 – Bo Cho and Frost Island, Mergui Archipelago,  Myanmar</strong><br />\n  Bo  Cho is the only island within the Lampi Marine National Park that has a ‘local  use’ zone and is one of the few in the Mergui Archipelago to actually be  inhabited. Most of the inhabitants in the area are sea gypsies, called Salon in  Myanmar. They used to live on boats during dry season and only remained on land  during rainy season. They still practice the same fishing and boat building  techniques used for generation. In the present times some salon inhabitants  dwell peacefully on this island permanently with other people in the Ma Kyone  Galet Salon Village located on Bo Cho’s northern side. A festival of the Salon  is held hear once a year.<br />\n  In the afternoon,  we will visit one of the smaller islands, known as Frost Island.&nbsp; Apart from the white beaches that are perfect  for relaxation, the island has a range of interesting animals and birds to  offer: monitor lizards and Great Hornbills, kites, sea eagles and kingfishers are  found here, as well as nesting swiftlets.<br />\n  Our snorkelers and  divers will look for hard and soft corals, anemones and gorgonian fans as well  as nudibranches, cuttlefish, and octopuses, plus hundreds of colourful reef  fish.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 – Kawthaung, Myanmar, and at Sea</strong><br />\n  We will clear out  of Myanmar during breakfast and will be on our way to the Andaman Islands. Our  Expedition Team will be on the outer decks looking for wildlife or presenting  interesting talks about India’s far-flung Andaman archipelago.<br />\n  Enjoy the day at  sea relaxing, attending a food or wine seminar, visit The Spa or work out at  The Gym. There are many ways to keep you busy and entertained aboard <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 – Port Blair, India</strong><br />\n  During the morning,  we will be crossing the Andaman Sea and our lecturers would like to present  interesting talks. <br />\n  Our afternoon  destination is Port Blair, which the British had selected as the site for a  penal settlement. The capital of the islands between 1858 and 1941 was on  neighbouring Ross Island. This is where the authorities will clear <em>Silver Discoverer</em> into India. <br />\n  Once the ship is  cleared, we will visit the Cellular Jail –a National Monument- and the  Anthropological Museum.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 – South Cinque Island, India</strong><br />\n  Today we will  spend our time on the beach and in the water, looking for relaxation and  colourful reef fishes. <br />\n  During the morning, we will explore South Cinque and one of the most  spectacular beaches in the Andaman Islands. This is a specially designated  National Park Area with many opportunities for underwater exploration or simply  relaxing on one of the beaches. We will make the most of our morning visit and  will snorkel from the beach or from anchored Zodiacs. Snorkelers will want to  see snappers, Napoleon wrasses, tuna, moray eels, crayfish, nudibranchs, eagle  rays, stingrays, octopus, Moorish idols, star fish, lionfish, and many more.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 8-9 – At Sea </strong><br />\n  Two leisurely days  at sea will give you a chance to exchange notes with fellow travellers and take  advantage of amenities aboard <em>Silver  Discoverer</em>. Help our birdwatchers spot some of the seabirds found far away  from their nesting grounds, and let our experts prepare you for the visit to  Sri Lanka through lectures about wildlife and culture. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 – Trincomalee, Sri Lanka</strong><br />\n  Trincomalee has  one of the largest natural harbours of the world. <br />\n  The two options  for full day tours today are both UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the first option  is to drive to Polonnaruwa, the former capital of the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa.  Dating back to the 12th century, the ancient city is an excellent example of  how irrigation systems were planned to be able to maximise the use of rain. Its  ruins and statues are still today overpowering. The excursion to Polonnaruwa  will include a visit to the museum where by special arrangement the museum’s  curator will be at hand to answer any questions. A special buffet lunch will be  arranged in the wilderness, and while you have your meal, a traditional Sri  Lankan folk show will take place for you.<br />\n  Alternatively  travel to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Sigiriya- the city of the Rock  Fortress. Sigiriya is Asia’s best-preserved city centre dating back to the  first millennium. Its particular interest goes back to the 5th century, when  parricidal King Kassapa unrightfully seized the throne and fled to the peak of  reddish gneiss known as Lion’s Rock. This massive column of rock was used for the  construction of his palace. It is known that the area had been in use for  centuries and was used as a Buddhist monastery after Kassapa died. <br />\n  A massive wall  defends part of the lower city. Various features have been overgrown by the  forests and while one part has not yet been fully excavated, the other part is  known to have been the aristocratic quarter with terraced gardens, canals and  fountains. Formerly, the image of a lion had been constructed around the  outcrop, but the head collapsed and today only the feet and claws can be seen. <br />\n  On arrival in Sigiriya,  we will first visit the museum to get a good overview of the fortress, its  history, the objects found and those excavated. Here too the museum’s curator  will be at your disposal to answer any questions that you might have regarding  the legendary citadel.<br />\n  To see the top one  has to climb special staircases. At the summit of the rock is the fortified  palace with its ruined buildings, its cisterns and its rock sculptures. Apart  from the archaeological remains of the palace and city Sigiriya is famous for  the “Mirror Wall”. The surface of the rock had been polished to such an extreme  that one could see one’s reflection. Halfway up the rock, within an  inaccessible rocky shelter in the vertical wall of the western face, are rock  paintings known as 'The Maidens of the Clouds', 21 beautiful female figures.  The climb is not easy and takes approximately 2 hours.<br />\n  A sumptuous Sri  Lankan lunch –well deserved after the climb- will be served at a nearby hotel  before returning to <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 – Kirinda (for Yala National Park), Sri Lanka</strong><br />\n  We will start from the fishing  port of Kirinda for a visit to Yala National Park. Yala’s history as a wildlife  sanctuary goes back more than 115 years and it was declared a National Park in  1938. Situated in the southeast of Sri Lanka, the park covers 979 square kilometres.  A wide variety of wild animals live in the park, including one of the highest  densities of leopards in the world. Of the 215 bird species known six are  endemic. Its importance for birds is shown through the Kumana Bird Sanctuary.  Another important factor of the park is the conservation of Sri Lankan elephants  in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  Within the park we  will use 4WD vehicles with local trackers and naturalists and will learn about  the leopards, with information on the animal, its habitat, and the conservation  work that has gone (and is going) on to protect it.<br />\n  You will have a  Champagne brunch at a scenic spot in the forest. As a special treat, Professor  Sarath Kotagama, head of the department of Zoology of the University of Colombo  and Sri Lanka’s leading ornithologist, will talk about birding and conservation  in Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 – Galle, Sri Lanka</strong><br />\n  Today we want to  explore the ancient port of Galle and surrounding area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  We will visit a  working tea plantation near the small village of Akuressa. This privately owned  property is the only organic tea factory in southern Sri Lanka. The head  planter will introduce you to the fascinating process of tea production. You  will walk the fields, see the picking of the tea leafs by the local women and  partake in a tea tasting session. <br />\n  Afterwards depart  for Galle and its magnificent fort. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in  1988 as the best example of a fortified city built by Europeans in South and  South-East Asia showing the interaction between European architectural styles  and South Asian traditions, it is surrounded by the sea on three sides. <br />\n  Along these same  streets some of the colonial Dutch architecture has survived. The National Museum  of Galle uses a building going back to 1656, the oldest remaining Dutch  building in the fort, and has three galleries with collections not only going  back to the Portuguese, Dutch and British periods, but also includes displays  of the 15th century expeditions of Chinese Admiral Zheng He. <br />\n  During the  afternoon, the Videographer/Photographer will show the Voyage-DVD, permitting  you to relive the many extraordinary encounters and moments during your voyage.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 – Colombo, Sri Lanka&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>",

After settling  in, you will attend a safety briefing and be introduced to your Expedition  Team. Weather permitting we will have a sail-away cocktail on deck -an aperitif  might help to relax after your travels towards <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.<br />\n  We invite you to familiarise yourself with your new  home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of  many memorable meals in The Restaurant. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 – At  Sea</strong><br />\n  Unwind from your travels to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> and relax on the open decks, visit the Spa or Gym.  Follow our lecturers in their presentations about the natural history of the  Indian Ocean’s islands and animals.<br />\n  Tonight, the Captain will invite you to the Captain’s  Welcome Cocktail Party while our Executive Chef and Restaurant Manager will  invite you to The Restaurant and the Welcome Dinner. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 –  Uligamu, Maldives</strong><br />\n  The Maldives are made up of 1190 islands, of which 200  are inhabited. Atolls are the perfect place to unwind on a beach and watch the  waves lapping onto the sand. These islands are also a geographical marvel,  where thousands of fish swimming around the vivid corals are just a few feet  away from where you sit.<br />\n  Uligamu is one of the northernmost inhabited islands  of Haa Alif Atoll and the Maldives. Based on its location the island is visited  by many yachts on their way into or out of the Arabian Sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  While <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> is going to be cleared into the Maldives in Uligamu we will have  a look at the community of some 300 inhabitants. The island has been selected  as the first in the Maldives to use a combination of renewable energies via  wind turbines and solar panels in a micro grid, helping the island through more  efficient and non-pollutant energy distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 –  Hanifaru and Olhugiri, Maldives</strong><br />\n  The Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve comprises 75 islands,  13 of which are inhabited by a population of approximately 12,000 people. <br />\n  Maldivian coral reefs support a high diversity of reef  animals, including some 250 species of soft and hard corals and 1,200 reef and  reef-associated fish species. Hanifaru Bay and its resources were designated as  a Marine Protected Area in 2009. Hawksbill and green turtles, manta rays, whale  sharks and different species of seabirds use the reserve. Napoleon wrasses and  tawny nurse sharks frequent the area. Since this is also a Core Area of the  Biosphere Reserve scuba diving activities within the area are not allowed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  A small vegetated sand cay is located on the western  corner of the reef and the lagoon is relatively shallow, dominated by sand and  has no direct channels to the ocean. Turtles and seabirds utilize the island  for nesting purposes. On the southeastern side a small bay attracts megafauna  and at certain times over 250 individual manta rays and several whale sharks  have been recorded actively feeding in this area –obviously, such numbers are  exceptional.<br />\n  In the afternoon, we will&nbsp;be in front of&nbsp;tiny Olhugiri.  Olhugiri Island is an uninhabited island located at the southern end of Baa  Atoll. The island, lagoon and the surrounding&nbsp;reef area is protected. Olhugiri  is one of two islands in the entire Maldives with regular roosting frigatebirds,  mainly Lesser Frigate (<em>Fregata ariel</em>),  and Red-billed Tropicbirds. The island’s beaches are used by turtles for  nesting.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 –  Maalhaveli, Meemu Atoll, Maldives</strong><br />\n  Meemu Atoll has a population of 6,500 inhabitants and  33 islands, of which 9 are inhabited. Set like pearls on a necklace the islands  circle the lagoon which our divers and snorkelers will want to inspect at  Maalhaveli — to see what underwater creatures will pose for them. The surrounding coral reefs and dive  sites are virtually pristine, with intact and healthy corals and an abundance  of aquatic life where manta rays, turtles, reef sharks and all manner of  tropical reef fish can be seen.<br />\n  During the afternoon, we will head south. Let our  lecturers introduce you to further wonders laying ahead, both above and in the  water. <br />\n  Be prepared for a possible visit by Neptune, as we are  about to cross the Equator.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 –  Hithadoo, Addu Atoll, Maldives</strong><br />\n  Addu is the southernmost of the Maldives’ atolls and  Addu City is one of only two cities in the Maldives. Since Addu is some 540  kilometres south of Male, there even is an international airport on Gan, one of  Addu Atoll’s islands. <br />\n  We have the full day to explore both land and sea. Our  Expedition Team will accompany you on walks looking for birds and other  wildlife, while our Marine Biologist(s) will be there to show you some  exceptional reefs and underwater creatures</p>\n<p><strong>Days 7-9 – At  Sea</strong><br />\n  To cover the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean, we will  be at sea for three days. Our lecturers will offer talks preparing you for our  visit to the Seychelles, be it about its historical aspects or natural history.<br />\n  In addition you can unwind, relax, and make use of the Gym or Spa, or any of  the other amenities <em>Silver Discoverer</em> can offer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 –  Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> will clear into the Seychelles in Victoria, on the  island of Mahe, during the morning.<br />\n  We will take our time to have a look at Mahe which  houses almost 90% of the country’s inhabitants, yet the forests have rare  endemic plants found only in the Seychelles. Apart from the forests there are  three Marine Parks protecting underwater life.<br />\n  A visit to the nation’s capital Victoria would have to  include ‘Big Ben’, the local version of England’s iconic building. To get an  idea of the wide variety of plants found in the tropics, stroll through the  Botanic Gardens. A good viewpoint towards Morne Seychellois, the island’s  highest point, is from the former Capuchin Mission.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 – La  Digue and Praslin, Seychelles</strong><br />\n  La Digue probably is the best-known island of the  Seychelles since its rock formations are spectacular. The huge granite boulders  that are scattered along the shore resemble modern art sculptures and have been  featured in many books and on many postcards. Apart from its brilliant white  beaches and strangely shaped rocks, the island has a nature reserve and  colonial houses — all making for excellent photography. Take a step back in  time and visit <em>L’Union Estate</em> — see a  traditional copra mill and kiln and watch the antics of the estate’s population  of giant land tortoises or stroll around the majestic Plantation House framed  by giant granite boulders in landscaped gardens. This natural wonder is  classified as a National Monument.<br />\n  The estate is also home to the cemetery of the  original settlers of La Digue and to one of the most pristine beaches in  Seychelles — the legendary Source d’Argent — among the most photographed  beaches on earth.<br />\n  During lunch, <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> repositions and will anchor off Praslin Island, the site of the  fabulous Vallée de Mai, one of Seychelles’ two UNESCO World Heritage Sites. We  disembark after lunch via Zodiac to the picturesque Baie Ste. Anne jetty, to  drive up the scenic coastal road through a quaint fishing village and dense  forest of contrasting shades of green, to <em>Vallée  de Mai Nature Reserve</em>. With a population of 6,500 people, Praslin,  Seychelles’ second largest island, measures only 10km by 3.7km, but it has  substantial tracts of tropical forests with over 6,000 coco-de-mer palms with  enormous fan-shaped fronds. These trees can grow more than 100 feet tall,  living 800-1,000 years and are home to endemic birds, such as the Seychelles  Bulbul and the Seychelles Black Parrot. During our walking tour, you will  discover this mystical World Heritage Site famous for the coco-de-mer — the  largest seed in the plant kingdom weighing up to 40 pounds. Capture the  cathedral feel of this primeval forest and listen for the high pitched whistles  of the Black Parrot. Later we depart Vallée de Mai for Cote d’Or Beach, where  we have time for an afternoon swim or stroll along this beautiful beach. Enjoy  afternoon refreshments before heading back to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> in time for dinner.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 12 –  Desroches Island, Seychelles</strong><br />\n  Desroches Island is one of the Outer Islands of the  Seychelles and the main island of the Amirante Islands. Located 230 km  southwest of Mahé, it has a land area of only 3.24 square kilometres, but 15  kilometres of fine sand beaches. The northern part of the island is run as a  coconut plantation and farm, and there is a settlement on the northern shore.  The first coconut plantations were started in 1875 and copra is still processed  on the island before being transported to Mahé. We spend the morning exploring Desroches’  beautiful beach, returning to <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> for lunch.<br />\n  During the afternoon, we will continue our lecture  programme and prepare you for another spectacular UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 – At  Sea</strong><br />\n  Our lecturers will continue to provide several talks  and seminars to prepare you for the UNESCO World Heritage Site Aldabra. &nbsp; <br />\n  The atoll of Aldabra is one of the best-researched  atoll ecosystems in the world as a scientific research station was established  there and research has gone on and is going on -and our Marine Biologist,  Botanist and Ornithologist will all want to explain what makes the island and  its inhabitants so special.&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Days 14-15 –  Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles</strong><br />\n  Part of the Outer Islands of the Seychelles, Aldabra is  reputedly the world’s second largest atoll and has been described as “one of  nature’s treasures”, a “sanctuary”, and it will truly be a privilege to be able  to visit this UNESCO World Heritage Site.<br />\n  Because of its extreme isolation, Aldabra is virtually  untouched by humans. Its distinctive island fauna includes the Aldabra giant tortoise  (<em>Aldabrachelys gigantea</em>). About two  thirds of the world population of giant tortoises lives on Aldabra. As Aldabra  lacks freshwater and is difficult to access, Aldabra has not been developed for  tourism. No airport has been built, and only a handful of smaller ships (with  special permits) are allowed to call at this unique atoll.<br />\n  <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> will anchor off Aldabra for two days. We enjoy snorkelling experiences in the lagoon populated with eagle rays,  turtles, and coral gardens teeming with marine life. Time and tides permitting,  we cruise via Zodiac through narrow channels between fossilized coral islands,  and we cruise between mangrove-covered islands to observe large colonies of  nesting boobies and Great Frigatebirds soaring overhead. As the tides pump  water in and out of the lagoon, massive numbers of fish come and go through  channels to feed. We can sometimes snorkel in these same channels, allowing the  current to carry us along a magical scene.<br />\n  We intend to go ashore to visit the small scientific  research station on Picard Island and photograph the mighty tortoises living on  this isolated island that few travellers have the privilege to see.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 16 – At  Sea</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> will head for the Spice Islands -as the archipelago  around Zanzibar was known in former days.&nbsp;  Our lecturers will prepare you for a visit to Zanzibar and its truly  surprising history of European and Arabian influence and the trade that made  Zanzibar famous. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 17 – Zanzibar,  Tanzania</strong><br />\n  Today, we will visit the last UNESCO World Heritage  Site of our voyage: Stone Town — a good example of a Swahili coastal trading  town. At the City Market we can see and smell the tropical fruits that are on  offer and can see the freshly ground spices. Within walking distance is the  Anglican Church, built over the old Great Slave Market. Slaves from all over  East Africa had once been brought here and had been kept in underground  chambers. Our next stop will be a spice farm in the countryside. To get there  we will drive past the Old Arab Fort and Dr. Livingstone’s house.<br />\n  At the spice farm you will have a guided tour and can  taste some of the exotic spices and fruits grown here. The different plants are  grown for food flavouring, for cosmetics, as dyes and for traditional medicine.  The visit to the spice farm will be followed by lunch at a beach resort and  free time at the beach for swimming, beachcombing or relaxation.<br />\n  Alternatively you might want to go visit Jozani Nature Reserve, Zanzibar's only national park, for a guided tour of the Jozani Nature trail and mangrove boardwalk.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 18 – Dar es Salaam, Tanzania&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>",

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Male, Maldives</strong><br />\n  Arrive in Male and embark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>, settle in and attend a mandatory safety drill before leaving port. During the afternoon you will be introduced to some of the important crew members and your Expedition Team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — Hanifaru Bay, Baa Atoll, and Olhugiri, Baa Atoll, Maldives</strong><br />\n  The Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve comprises 75 islands, 13 of which are inhabited by a population of approximately 12,000 people. Maldivian coral reefs support a high diversity of reef animals, including some 250 species of soft and hard corals and 1,200 reef and reef-associated fish species. Hawksbill and green turtles, manta rays, whale sharks and different species of seabirds use the reserve. Napoleon wrasses and tawny nurse sharks frequent the area. Therefore Hanifaru Bay and its resources were designated as a Marine Protected Area in 2009. Since this is also a Core Area of the Biosphere Reserve scuba diving activities within the area are not allowed. </p>\n<p>A small vegetated sand cay is located on the western corner of the reef and the lagoon is relatively shallow, dominated by sand and has no direct channels to the ocean. Turtles and seabirds utilize the island for nesting purposes. On the south-eastern side a small bay attracts megafauna and at certain times over 250 individual manta rays and several whale sharks have been recorded actively feeding in this area –obviously, such numbers are exceptional.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon we will visit tiny Olhugiri. Olhugiri Island is an uninhabited island located at the southern end of Baa Atoll. The island, lagoon and the surrounding&nbsp;reef area is protected. Olhugiri is one of two islands in the entire Maldives with regular roosting frigatebirds, mainly Lesser Frigatebirds, and Red-billed Tropicbirds. The island’s beaches are used by turtles for nesting.<br />\n</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 — Vangaaru and Uligamu Island, Maldives</strong><br />\n  One of the northernmost little islands in the Maldives, Vangaaru offers picture perfect white sand beaches, a barrier reefs, and on land tall coconut trees. If you are keen on snorkelling you might encounter manta rays or moray eels. Black sea cucumbers scour the sandy bottom for food while and snorkelers will have views of myriads of fish. A stroll onshore will reveal countless hermit crabs and innumerable shells, and the occasional shorebirds.</p>\n<p>Just slightly to the east of Vangaaru, Uligamu is one of the northernmost inhabited islands of Haa Alif Atoll and the Maldives. Based on its location the island is visited by many yachts on their way into or out of the Arabian Sea. The island has been selected as the first in the Maldives to use a combination of renewable energies via wind turbines and solar panels in a micro grid, helping the island through more efficient and non-pollutant energy distribution.</p>\n<p>While <em>Silver Discoverer</em> is cleared out of the Maldives in Uligamu, we will have a look at the community of some 300 inhabitants.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 – Minicoy, Lakshadweep Islands, India</strong><br />\n  Largely unexplored and unknown, both above and below the water, the Lakshadweep Sea is home to 36 little islands, one of the most spectacular tropical island systems. Most of the islands are inhabited only by birds and hermit crabs. The precious heritage of the Lakshadweep’s ecology and culture is supported by an extremely fragile ecosystem. </p>\n<p>The southernmost island of the group in the Lakshadweep, Minicoy, is geographically isolated from other islands. The culture here is a mix of Maldivian and South Indian. &nbsp;Minicoy is about 10.6 km long and is the second largest island in the Lakshadweep Group and is almost completely covered with coconut trees.</p>\n<p>Not only will Minicoy be our entrance point to India, this morning stop can be used to explore the island with its many coconut palm trees and nice beaches. The island itself is the southern part of a tear-shaped atoll. In the unspoiled waters of the lagoon, living coral reefs of vibrant blue, green, and yellow ring the island and are home to many colourful reef fish, from lion fish to angel fish to butterfly fish. In the clear blue water, you will see a spectacular display of ocean life, including squid, octopi, sea cucumbers, rays, crabs, and even green or hawks bill turtles. It is believed that several shipwrecks initiated construction of the lighthouse in 1885. These wrecks are virtual underwater museums and fish species found here are said to be larger than average normal size found elsewhere. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Perumal Reef, Lakshadweep Islands, India</strong><br />\n  Perumal Par, a submerged bank has some of the most beautiful and virgin reefs in the world. One can discover a whole new underwater world at this reef in almost total solitude. Not too far to the east are Thinnakara Island and Bangaram Island<strong>,</strong> both sharing a vast lagoon and<strong> </strong>coralline banks -the actual lagoon<strong> </strong>area amounts to 125 square kms. </p>\n<p>Thinnakara is a tiny teardrop shaped island whose panorama encompasses the magnificent lagoon, sun-drenched sand and the enchantment of swaying palms, spectacular marine flora and fauna. A shallow lagoon enclosed by a coral reef surrounds the island.&nbsp; Here the sun, sand and surf in cast a spell on its visitors. The crystal clear water, the coral reef and blue lagoon perform magic. A sense of well-being may well take over, as one discovers the graceful school of fish, hermit crabs and seabirds in lush coconut groves.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Cheriyam, Lakshadweep Islands, India</strong><br />\n  Cheriyam is one of the easternmost islands in the Lakshadweep Archipelago. Together with Kalpeni it sits on the same eastern side of an atoll of roughly 26 square kilometres. Cheriyam is the northernmost of the two, and although owned by the 49 families of Kalpeni, it has only 10 inhabitants. A road leads from the small settlement to a lighthouse on the northern tip.</p>\n<p>Officials and representatives of Kalpeni will come to meet us and umbrellas, chairs and tables will have been set up to relax on the beach and under the trees. The reef wall drops steeply and is alive with fish. The island has clear, shallow lagoon waters not only ideal for sea cucumbers but also for relaxing moments in the water. Perhaps you will choose to relax in the shade, take walks on the wonderful beach, explore a little inland amongst the coconut groves, or snorkel off by Zodiac and swim from the beach.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Beypore, India</strong><br />\n  Beypore is located in Kozhikode at the mouth of the Chaliyar River. Historically, it was an important trade and maritime centre during the days of the early Arab, Chinese and later the European voyages. Formerly known as Calicut it was an important centre for Malabar trade in spices and textiles. The shipbuilding yard at Beypore port is famous for its traditional construction of the ‘Uru’ or the Arabian trading vessel. This tradition of shipbuilding is nearly 1,500 years old, and the craftsmanship of the workers here is exceptional.</p>\n<p>We will either witness wooden Dhows being built or will proceed to Feroke Tile factory. Feroke is the cradle of the tile industry in Kerala. Then we proceed by coach to the nearby weaving Centre Tasara, a creative and experimental weaving centre where hand weaving and all related textile activities including, dyeing, batik, tie &amp; dye, block and screen printing are taught.</p>\n<p>We will continue to Calicut, to a venue for our exclusive use and refreshments followed by a Kalaripayattu performance – the training in the traditional style of combat. The rituals include the worship of certain Hindu Gods inside the Kalari, the arena. After the Kalaripayattu performance, treat yourself to a sumptuous Mopilah lunch which will be specially catered by a celebrity chef - Mrs. Faiza Moosa. After the lunch, you will be driven to the busiest street in Kozhikode to try a variety of local Halwa. Today the street bustles with shops that sell anything and everything including locally famous sweets and banana chips.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Days 8-9 — Cochin, India</strong><br />\n  The next two days we will spend in southern India’s port of Cochin, in the state of Kerala. Because of the location between China and Europe and the spice trade the port and town have had many foreign powers interested in this area. Since Cochin was an important spice trading centre and had easy access to the sea it used to be called “Queen of the Arabian Sea”. Once we have cleared into India, we will be welcomed with a traditional Kerala <em>shinkari melam</em>, a group of 18 musicians playing traditional instruments.</p>\n<p>Setting out from the port, we will drive through one of India’s most beautiful and tranquil landscapes to visit Alleppey, the “City of Canals” or “Venice of the East”, located south of Cochin between the Arabian Sea and Lake Vembanad, India’s longest lake. Alleppey’s port was opened to foreign trade by the British in the late 18th century to end the Dutch commercial supremacy in Cochin. We will board a houseboat and cruise the river, lake and canals, collectively known as “the Backwaters”, and have a look at old colonial warehouses and typical thatched local homes. Brilliant green paddy fields where farming is done below sea level, will give way to views of village life and glimpses of churches, mosques and temples. While we cruise the “Backwaters” a typical Keralan snack with tea, south Indian coffee and fruit juices will be served.<br />\n  &nbsp;<br />\n  After the cruise we will reach a special location, beautifully illuminated by hundreds of oil lamps giving it an earthly spiritual feel for an exclusive Mohiniyattam performance that will be done by Keralan women in traditional attire. After this exceptional presentation you will be treated to a special Syrian Christian dinner. The Christians of Kerala are known for their cuisine mixing Indian and European influences.</p>\n<p>The following morning we will board local cruise boats to reach Fort Cochin. In Cochin we will walk through the Heritage city to see the wonderful array of architectural styles dating back to the Portuguese, British and Dutch periods, before the East India Company took over in 1814. There are Portuguese churches including the oldest Portuguese church in India going back to the year 1503, a Jewish synagogue, as well as mosques and Hindu temples. During the walk we visit the Indo-Portuguese Museum and finally the David Hall Gallery. Here a prominent historian will talk about the history of Cochin and the spice trade, followed by a Kalaripayattu (martial arts) performance. Following the performance you will be treated to a special Mopilah lunch catered by a celebrity chef. The Mopilah are Muslims from the Malabar region and known for their food.</p>\n<p>From the gallery you will take local Tuk-Tuks (open 2-seater taxis) to reach the Mattancheri Palace built by the Raja of Kochi. We will visit the Palace, walk to the Jewish Synagogue and Dutch Palace and will have some spare time to wander around Jew Town, looking at souvenir and antique shops before being taken back to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> by local boats.<br />\n  &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Vilanjam, India</strong><br />\n  Today we visit the largest wooden palace in India, dating back to the 16th century. The palace is a fine specimen of Keralan architecture with antique interiors, intricate rosewood carvings and sculpted décor. The sheer size, style and materials are overwhelming –the palace used to feed 2000 people on a daily basis with a hall able to accommodate everyone.</p>\n<p>During the afternoon <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will leave and head for Sri Lanka and Galle.<br />\n  &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Galle, Sri Lanka</strong><br />\n  During the morning our on board Videographer will screen our documentary-style voyage video. </p>\n<p>Once <em>Silver Discoverer</em> has cleared into Sri Lanka, we want to explore the ancient Muslim port of Galle. The different political influences from Europe can be seen at the Galle Fort, which has been occupied by the Portuguese, Dutch and British until the late 19th century. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988, it is surrounded by the sea on three sides. Walking along the narrow streets one can best absorb the atmosphere of this living fort. Along these same narrow streets some of the colonial Dutch architecture has survived. The 18th century Dutch church has a splendid wooden memorial to one of the commanders of Galle, but we will also see the Arab quarter with its distinctly Moorish touch. </p>\n<p>Enjoy a High Tea at the Rampart Hotel before returning back to Silver Discoverer.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Colombo, Sri Lanka</strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Colombo, Sri Lanka</strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Discoverer</em> and depart on your exciting Silversea Expedition “Mythical Lands of Bengal.” After settling in you will attend a safety briefing and be introduced to your Expedition Team. Weather permitting we will have a sail-away cocktail on deck.</p>\n<p>  We invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in the Restaurant. An aperitif will permit you to relax after your travels towards <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — Galle, Sri Lanka</strong><br />\nToday we want to depart for an excursion to a nearby tea estate for a complete tea experience. The tour of the tea estate will introduce you to the fascinating process of tea production, starting from the picking of the leaf by local women to the weighing, processing and packaging the leaf at the factory. A tea tasting session will follow, where one will have the opportunity of tasting different varieties of tea.</p>\n<p>  Later in the morning we will explore the ancient Muslim port of Galle. The different political influences from Europe can be seen at the Galle Fort, which has been occupied by the Portuguese, Dutch and British until the late 19th century. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988, it is surrounded by the sea on three sides. Walking along the narrow streets one can best absorb the atmosphere of this living fort. Along these same narrow streets some of the colonial Dutch architecture has survived. The 18th century Dutch church has a splendid wooden memorial to one of the commanders of Galle, but we will also see the Arab quarter with its distinctly Moorish touch. </p>\n<p>For lunch we will drive to Unawatuna Beach Resort at one of Sri Lanka’s best beaches for a Sri Lankan seafood barbecue, accompanied by Sri Lankan Baila musicians. You ca also enjoy a dip in the ocean. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 — Kirinda, Sri Lanka</strong><br />\nKirinda is located just south of the Yala (Ruhuna) National Park — our main point of interest for the day. Yala’s history as a wildlife sanctuary goes back more than 114 years and it was declared a National Park in 1938. Situated in the southeast of Sri Lanka, the park covers 979 square kilometres. A wide variety of wild animals live in the park, including one of the highest densities of leopards in the world. Of the 215 bird species known six are endemic. Its importance for birds is shown through the Kumana Bird Sanctuary. Another important factor of the park is the conservation of Sri Lankan elephants in it.</p>\n<p>  Yala has a variety of ecosystems — from moist monsoon forests to marine wetlands — so not only birders will want to visit this exceptional National Park. While in the park, enjoy a Champagne forest brunch where a renowned Sri Lankan naturalist will give a brief lecture on the ornithological and ecological importance of Yala National Park.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 – Trincomalee, Sri Lanka</strong><br />\nTrincomalee is our starting point for two options for full-day tours today – both visiting UNESCO World Heritage Sites. </p>\n<p>The first option is to drive to the capital of the former Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. Dating back to the 12th century the ancient city is an excellent example of ancient irrigation systems. Its ruins and statues are still today overpowering. The excursion to Polonnaruwa will include a visit to the museum where by special arrangement the museum’s curator will be at hand to answer any questions. </p>\n<p>A special buffet lunch will be arranged in the wilderness, and while you have your meal a traditional Sri Lankan folk show will take place for you.</p>\n<p>Alternatively travel to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Sirigiya- the city of the Rock Fortress. Sirigiya is Asia’s best-preserved city centre dating back to the first millennium. Various features have been overgrown by the forests and can still be excavated. Formerly the image of a lion had been constructed at the base of the outcrop of reddish gneiss known as Lion’s Rock. The rock was used for the construction of King Kasyapa‘s palace, but unfortunately the head collapsed and today only the feet and claws can be seen. </p>\n<p>On arrival in Sirigiya we will first visit the museum. Here too the museum’s curator will be at your disposal to answer any questions that you might have regarding the legendary citadel. To see the top one has to climb special staircases. At the summit of the rock is the fortified palace with its ruined buildings, its cisterns and its rock sculptures. Apart from the archaeological remains of the palace and city Sirigiya is famous for the “Mirror Wall”. The surface of the rock had been polished to such an extreme that one could see one’s reflection. Halfway up the rock, within an inaccessible rocky shelter in the vertical wall of the western face, are rock paintings known as 'The Maidens of the Clouds'. </p>\n<p>A sumptuous Sri Lankan lunch –well deserved after the climb- will be served at a nearby hotel before returning to <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 5-6 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Having spent the first part of our voyage in Sri Lanka it is now our time to head over to India’s Andaman Islands. Let our lecturers revive the exploratory voyages of the Portuguese, Dutch and English of the 15th to 19th century. From the early spice traders to the later merchants, so many interests were there for the western world. Find out how this has influenced and if it still influences India and Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p>These two days at sea will also be a perfect way to you to get prepared for the Andaman Islands and you can attend lectures that will let you understand the special history and natural history of the Andaman Islands. Be sure to take time out to relax on deck, make use of the gym, or visit the Spa.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Port Blair, Andaman Islands, India</strong><br />\nIn the late morning we arrive at Port Blair, the Andaman Islands’ main town and only port of entry. Once we have cleared into India officially, we can have a look at this quaint and friendly Indian town that seems to have been transported in a time capsule from the 1940s to the 21st century. </p>\n<p>You will have a choice to see three museums in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands’ capital on South Andaman Island. These museums cover the islands’ various aspects: the Samudrika Marine Museum, run by the Indian Navy, has exhibits about corals, shells and fishes, even an aquarium. The Anthropological Museum has exhibits relating to the life of the four local tribes of the Andaman Islands and the two groups on the Nicobar Islands. After some light refreshment and a specially arranged presentation about the indigenous tribal communities by an anthropologist there will be a brief Nicobar tribal dance performance. </p>\n<p>The Cellular Jail, where a dark chapter of the British use of the Andaman Islands as a place to exile political opponents is shown. Built in the late 19th, early 20th century, it could house 693 inmates in single cells. The prison was set up in such a way that no inmates could communicate with each other. Three of the seven wings still exist and together with the central watchtower have been declared a national monument. Ms Rashida Iqbal, the curator, will explain about the prison and the inmates that were imprisoned here after their struggle for India’s independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — South Cinque, North Cinque Island and Ross Island, India</strong><br />\nDuring the morning we will explore South Cinque and some of the most spectacular beaches in the Andaman Islands. This is a specially designated National Park Area with many opportunities for underwater exploration or simply relaxing on one of the beaches. Make the most of our morning visit and will snorkel from the beach or from anchored Zodiacs. Snorkelers will want to see snappers, Napoleon wrasses, tuna, moray eels, crayfish, nudibranches, eagle rays, stingrays, octopus, Moorish idols, star fish, lionfish, and many more.</p>\n<p>  Our afternoon destination is North Cinque Island, which is actually a group of three islands that are partly connected by sandbanks. Here too, we will have excellent possibilities to swim and snorkel.</p>\n<p>In the evening <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be in front of Ross Island, which the British had selected as the capital of the islands between 1858 and 1941. Today the island has the old buildings, the church, printing press, government offices, Chief Commissioner’s house, and cemetery in ruins and trees overgrow many areas. <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will clear out of the Andaman Islands and India at Ross Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  While <em>Silver Discoverer</em> covers the distance from the Andaman Islands to the Mergui Archipelago our lecturers will keep you entertained with stories of adventure and facts of natural history. Perhaps you would like to exercise in the Gym, or have a Spa treatment. Since we have been to Sri Lanka, an important tea producing country, why not sample some of the different varieties we have on board while attending Team Trivia.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Myeik, Myanmar</strong><br />\n<em>Silver Discoverer</em> will reach Myeik in the morning and after clearing the ship into Myanmar, we will start our exploration of this important coastal town with its checkered history and many ethnic groups.</p>\n<p>  Myeik is one of the two entry ports for the Mergui Archipelago located to the southwest. The town has a long and proud nautical history and because of the English, Dutch and French interests in trading in the 16th to 19th century is said to have one of the best kept collections of wooden colonial era buildings in South-East Asia. Despite the fact that the town is the largest of southern Myanmar with some 250,000 inhabitants the area and waters surrounding it are relatively unspoilt. Two little islands in front of Myeik offer interesting views and a 72m long Buddha can be found there. Pearl farming is done here and the town also hosts one of the largest fish markets in southern Myanmar. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Lampi Island and Bo Cho Island, Mergui Archipelago, Myanmar </strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor in front of Lampi Island in the early morning. During this day in the Mergui Archipelago we want to explore the Lampi Marine National Park and take advantage of Lampi Island. Declared an ASEAN Heritage Park in 2003, the Lampi Marine National Park protects evergreen and mangrove forests, beaches and dunes, coral reefs, sea grasses and a rich biodiversity of over 1000 recorded species<em>.</em></p><p>The uninhabited Lampi, apart from having occasional fishing nomads stop over, is large enough to hold wild animals. With rainforest and a fringing coral reef, Lambi’s outstanding beauty is enhanced by spotting macaques, dusky langur and lesser mouse-deer, as well as four species of hornbills, eight different kingfishers, White-bellied Sea Eagles and some of the other 215 bird species recorded. Kyun Tan Shey and the surrounding islands offer beaches regardless of tides. More than 50 white sand beaches and fringing reefs wait to be used for snorkelling, bird-watching or just relaxing. At this spectacular island you will have the choice of a jungle walk, exploring along a mangrove estuary or snorkelling. The sea grass meadows surrounding Lampi provide important food for green sea turtles and dugongs.</p><p>In the afternoon we will visit lush Bo Cho Island to the south of Lampi. Bo Cho Island is a sacred home for the Moken (Sea Gypsy) and a small Moken resettlement zone has been established here which has turned into a year-round Moken village. The people are so connected to the ocean that their houses are all built on stilts near the shore where they can keep a watchful island on their boats and the sea. Some 1000 Moken people have made Bo Cho their home and a basic infrastructure supports them. A yearly festival to honour their culture and way of life takes place on Bo Cho. We will want to see their homes and see their unique boat designs. We also might get to see how the Moken catch their fish.<br />\n</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Frost Island and Kawthaung, Myanmar</strong><br />\n  Frost Island is in the ‘Mid-Group’ of the Mergui Archipelago. Tiny Frost Island in particular is known for large fig trees growing right on the beach and hundreds of hermit crab residents on its powdery white-sand beaches. The Moken are the only human inhabitants of this area. A chance to meet them is always a possibility. Frost Island is also rich in options for snorkelling amongst schools of brightly coloured tropical fish thanks to the surrounding coral reefs, clear waters, and a long sandy beach on the northern shore. </p>\n<p>  In the afternoon <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will reach Kawthaung, our point of exit from the Mergui Archipelago before reaching our final port in Thailand. </p>\n<p>  During the afternoon we will have the Videographer’s presentation of the voyage recap on DVD. Enjoy those marvellous takes and moments of our voyage through the “Mythical Lands of Bengal.”</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 — Phuket, Thailand</strong><br />\nAfter breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 – Phuket, Thailand</strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Discoverer</em> in Phuket to start your, “Expedition Through Ancient Siam and Indochina.” After settling in, you will attend a mandatory safety drill before leaving port. This evening you will be introduced to important members of the crew and the Expedition Team. Get to know some of your fellow travellers over a sail away cocktail and enjoy the first of many memorable dinners in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 – Ko Panyi and Phang Nga Bay, Thailand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nPhang Nga Bay covers an area of 400 square kilometers and is home to some 100 islands. One in particular was featured in the 1974 James Bond movie, “Man with the Golden Gun,” and has been an attraction ever since.</p>\n<p>This morning a local guide will meet us in our Zodiacs to head to Ko Panyi Village, which was built on stilts about 200 years ago at the feet of a giant limestone cliff. Only a very small part of the village rests on solid ground, the rest slowly continues to grow outwards supported on a handmade framework out over the water. Upon arrival we will be welcomed by resident musicians. Following the concert we will have the chance to walk through the village to a local school where we will meet the school children and see a Thai dance show before leaving from the village to explore the mangrove forest and a transfer back to <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p>This afternoon, discover a unique and hidden world by canoe.&nbsp; Together with the Expedition team and local guides we will explore Hong Island in local canoes. Weave your way through a network of brilliant crystalline limestone caves. These \"hongs\" are actually collapsed cave systems in the interior of each island. They can only be accessed using the tough, purpose-designed inflatable canoes that permit access through sea-caves at low tide. Open to the sky and filled with jungle flora and fauna, the hongs conceal a unique eco-system.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 – Ko Ra Wi, Thailand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n  Today we venture into areas seldom visited by cruise or expedition ship travellers. The Ko Tarutao Marine Park was established in 1974, and the roughly 50 under-developed and jungle-covered islands are well off the beaten track. Our fleet of Zodiacs will make the journey to the island of Ko Ra Wi, where local guides will be waiting to brief us and introduce the island. Our goal this morning is a viewpoint called, “Pha Chado,” which was an observation point for pirates in the past. Nowadays, this stunning overlook requires about 40 minutes of walking to reach the top. Well worth the effort, the view from the Chado cliff overlooks lines of trees and the white sandy capes of nearby islands. Gratified by the view, return to the beach where a selection of seasonal fruits awaits you. If time allows following the hike, the marine park offers excellent snorkelling and swimming.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>By lunchtime, we will bid farewell to Thailand and board <em>Silver Discoverer</em> as she crosses the Malacca Strait headed south for Indonesia.&nbsp; Enjoy a relaxing afternoon and take in a lecture presentation to prepare you for our time in Sumatra. <br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Days 4-5 – Belawan, Sumatra, Indonesia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nSumatra is the fourth largest island in the world and offers magnificent natural landscapes. <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will go alongside in Belawan, Sumatra’s busiest port for container ships exporting minerals, oil, palm oil, rubber, tea and tobacco, but for our little expedition ship, Belawan is the gate to Gunung Leuser National Park located in the interior of Sumatra and running along the Barisan mountain-ridge. </p>\n<p>The park covers roughly 9000 square kilometres and is one of Indonesia’s oldest and possibly least visited parks. It is also part of the prized UNESCO World Heritage site known as the, “Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra.” The mountainous reserve is home to more than 660 species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and birds. Over 4000 plant species, including the fascinating corpse flower (<em>Rafflesia arnoldii)</em> and titan arum (<em>Amorphophallus titanum),</em> can be found here.</p>\n<p>At the Bukit Lawang Visitor Center we will be briefed by a ranger about our visit and planned hike in the park, hoping for a chance to see orangutans in the wild. In addition to the Sumatran orangutan, there are eight other primate species to watch for in the verdant forests.&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 – Malacca, Malaysia </strong><br />\n<em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor early this morning off the ancient port city of Malacca with its intriguing blend of culture, languages, festivals, lifestyles and food. </p>\n<p>Today, we plan to explore the historic city with its streets and buildings that illustrate a prosperous trading heritage. The excursion begins with visits to Dutch fortifications and buildings dating back to the 1600s. Continue on to the ruins of St Paul’s Church, originally built by the Portuguese.&nbsp; Visit the Sultanate Palace, a replica of the original 15th Century wooden palace, which is now the Cultural Museum.&nbsp; For a panoramic view of the city, ride up to the top of the modern Menara Taming Sari viewing tower where you can overlook the city from a height of 110 metres. Carry on to Malacca’s Chinatown where you can see 19th Century Baroque-style homes of wealthy Chinese families. Temples, antique and curio shops line the streets. </p>\n<p>After being immersed in the rhythms and colors of the ancient city of Malacca, return to <em>Silver Discoverer </em>for a relaxing afternoon at sea as we make way for the Tioman group of Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Pulau Sibu and Rawa Island, Malaysia</strong><br />\nBoth islands we will visit today fall within the Babi Besar, or Tioman, group of islands. Pulau Sibu, our destination for the morning, was once a haunt of pirates, but is better known today for it beaches and beauty and is favoured as a getaway for Singapore’s expats. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Rawa Island is home to one of the first resorts built in the area, owned by a nephew of the Sultan of Johore. This island in particular is not hard to identify, as its name is carved into the rocky elevations. To the north of Rawa are a number of small islets and exposed rocks that offer snorkelling around their bases. </p>\n<p>Using our Zodiacs for remote landings and snorkel excursions, we will explore the islands throughout the day, taking advantage of all they have to offer in terms of beaches, snorkeling, nature walks, birdwatching and more. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 8-9 — At Sea</strong><br />\nOver the course of two days, the <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will ply the waters of the Gulf of Thailand northward to cross from the Malaysian Peninsula, to the shores of Cambodia. While at sea, take some time to enjoy the exemplary service onboard.&nbsp; Perhaps this is your opportunity to enjoy a late breakfast in the privacy of your suite. Later, you may choose to join the expedition team on deck, attend a lecture, connect with new friends for a long leisurely lunch, or savor a sunset cocktail around the pool as the sun slips below the horizon. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Sihanoukville and Koah Rong Sanloem, Cambodia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nThe early morning will find <em>Silver Discoverer </em>alongside in bustling Sihanoukville.&nbsp; From here, after clearing into Cambodia, we plan to visit the Preah Sihanouk National Park. The park was established in 1993, inaugurated in March 1995, and encompasses 21,000 hectares of coastal area including sandy beaches, mangrove forests, the Prek Teuk Sap estuary, off-shore coral reefs and two islands (Koh Thmei and Koh She). Though rarely seen, the park provides refuge for such species as macaques, sun bear, mouse deer, pangolin, and over a hundred species of birds. After arriving at the park by motor coach enjoy a relaxing boat ride through the jungle and mangroves out into the ocean.</p>\n<p><em>Silver Discoverer</em> will relocate during lunch to Koah Rong Sanloem, owned by the Cambodian Navy. </p>\n<p>Koah Rong Samloem is a world away from Sihanoukville, with just a few paths crossing from one side of the island to the other. These access points offer us a chance to see some of the resident wildlife on the island, including macaws, toucans, fishing eagles and a variety of reptiles. Starting from the heart shaped Saracen Bay, there is a path to the old lighthouse at the southwestern corner of the island and also paths through to Lazy Beach, Robinson Bungalows and Huba-Huba Bungalows on the sunset side of the island. </p>\n<p>At sunset this evening we will experience a real highlight of the voyage, a chance to see Apsara dancing, and a practice that dates back to the 8th century. The dancers train for many years to achieve their graceful postures with arched fingers and feet. In addition, the ancient art of shadow puppetry will be demonstrated, telling folktales with comic characters. Enjoy both performances, relaxing on the beach, whilst being served drinks and canapes. As the evening winds down, return to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> by Zodiac for a stunning dinner aboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Krong Kampot, Cambodia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nThis morning we will investigate more of Cambodia from our hub of Krong Kampot, a provincial capital composed of 19th century French colonial architecture and known for producing high quality pepper. </p>\n<p>One outing this morning will focus on nearby Kep National Park, protecting low land tropical forest. This is the perfect place to stretch your legs with an 8 km circuit winding through thick forest, passing temples and spectacular viewpoints. Upon completing the natural history walk within the park, we will drive to the seaside resort of Kep. In 1908, Kep was a favorite with the French elite. Today, it is famous for its splendid seafood, and especially crab. Now that you have worked up an appetite, it is time to stop by one of the local crab shacks where the crab meat is sweet and comes straight from the sea. Sit back, relax, and enjoy your crab with a refreshing cold drink.</p>\n<p>Kampot pepper is regarded as the best pepper that one can buy. During French colonial times most restaurants used Kampot pepper due to its unique sweet flavor. However, in the early 1970s, the Khmer Rouge destroyed all the pepper plantations and it was only years later that seedlings were found again in Kampot. To learn more of this story, travel by coach to a pepper plantation to see the beautifully arranged pepper plants stretching far into the distance. You will learn how pepper is grown and prepared for export, and have an opportunity to take some of this highly prized spice home with you.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to travel on to Kep after your visit to the pepper plantation to sample the famous fresh crab of the region at one of the local crab shacks where the crab meat is undeniably delicious. Perhaps try it with Khmer sauce – salt, pepper and lime. </p>\n<p>Return to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> as we chart a course for Vietnam with an afternoon at sea. Lectures from the Expedition Team will prepare you for the coming days in Vietnam.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 – Con Som, Vietnam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nSleep in today and perhaps attend a lecture presentation as we enjoy a morning at sea. Around lunchtime, <em>Silver Discoverer </em>will anchor outside of Con Dao, an area that had a reputation as a labor camp. Today, it is a place for the Vietnamese to remember and express their gratitude to fallen soldiers. </p>\n<p>Once ashore, we will use the afternoon to visit the Con Dao historical museum, where black and white photographs present a chilling reminder of the past. Next, visit the historical pier no. 914 where it is said 914 prisoners died while constructing the pier. Continue to Phu Hai and Phu Son prison, dating back to 1862 and the largest of the 11 jails on the island. Meet a local war veteran who will give you a personal insight into those trying times. Your final stop before returning to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> for the evening is Mrs. Phi Yen temple.</p>\n<p>Return to the ship by Zodiac as the sun sets on this historical reminder of a difficult time in our pasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 – Cruise the Tien River and Cai Be, Mekong Delta, Vietnam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nToday we enter the Mekong River Delta of southwest Vietnam. This nearly 40,000 km2 &nbsp;area drains lands from China southward all the way to the South China Sea.&nbsp;After a morning spent watching the commerce on the delta and working our way up the Tien River (The Upper Mekong River), <em>Silver Discoverer</em> approaches Cai Be, a small town of Tien Giang Province. There are several options lined up for your day in this region.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival you may choose to board a local boat and glide through the waterways of the Mekong Delta passing the floating market that sells everything from seasonal fruits to rice noodles for breakfast. Disembark at a local village where you will be able to visit one of the ancient houses. Enjoy refreshments while spending time with the owner of the property. The final stop will be at a local primary school where you can teach the children some English words while you brush up on your Vietnamese before returning to the ship at anchor.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you will be keen for an offering that gets you moving, in which case transfer by bus from the landing jetty to the small village that is home of the coveted, “Hoa Loc mango.” Here we will use bicycles to explore beautifully intimate roads that reveal traditional houses and the rhythms of daily life. Next, enjoy a boat cruise to An Binh Island to take a small rowboat deeper into the peaceful countryside on small canals. A short walk will bring you to a local house for a taste of some local snacks with hot tea.</p>\n<p>In several Mekong Delta provinces the local people preserve a traditional way of fishing in which they manually drain ditches to catch fish. Today you will have the option to work alongside local farmers who will teach you the art of \"Bailing ditches – Catching Fish.\" After boarding local boats, cruise to a nearby canal where the floating market of Cai Be takes place. Here you will visit a local house and be given a “bà ba” – a southern Vietnamese traditional dress – to wear. It is here, under the guidance of the locals that you will learn to bail ponds and catch fish. After your hard work, enjoy a well-deserved cup of tea and snacks, while listening to folk music. In this peaceful land, friends and neighbors often gather together to share moments like this.</p>\n<p>However you spend your afternoon, return to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> to exchange stories of the day with your fellow travellers over a delicious dinner in The Restaurant, as we get underway for Ho Chi Minh City.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 — Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nHo Chi Minh City (or Saigon as it is locally known) lies on the Saigon River, a tributary of the massive Mekong River delta. Take in the river system from start to finish out on deck as the ship steams towards her berth in the city.&nbsp; Mangrove forests along the shore contain nipa palms, red mangroves, and swiftlet condominiums for the cultivation of lucrative birds’ nest soup.&nbsp; The morning’s passage upriver will bring both small local fishing boats and large cargo vessels until we come alongside in the afternoon.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>We have arranged several options for you in Ho Chi Minh City and once alongside, you will have the choice to set out on a tour exploring the highlights of one of the most vibrant cities in Southeast Asia from the back of a motor scooter to travel just like the locals do daily. This afternoon scooter ride will visit attractions such as flower market, Ho Thi Ky, and the atmospheric Ong Bon Pagoda in Chinatown. Your driver will then zip you back to the city centre to visit the Notre Dame Cathedral, passing by the Chinese medicine street on the way. Next to the cathedral is the Grand Central Post Office, designed by Gustav Eiffel it has been beautifully preserved and offers visitors a chance to imagine life in the time of the Indochinese Empire. Change to motor coaches for your final stop at Ben Thanh market, where you will enjoy a glass of Vietnamese coffee. The rest of the afternoon is yours for independent exploration of this fabulous city.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>Alternatively, see the city highlights in a more traditional way – by coach – to visit the History Museum and the Reunification Palace built on the site of the former Norodom Palace. Continue to Notre Dame Cathedral and the classic 19th century French colonial Post Office. Explore Cholon, “Chinatown,” and a prosperous area that has been engaged in trading activities since the 17th century. Known for its Chinese delis, ancient quarters, old temples and pagodas, the area reflects original architecture and age-old rituals. </p>\n<p>In one final afternoon offering for Saigon, learn the fundamentals of delicious Vietnamese cuisine at the GRAIN cooking school. Founded by local celebrity chef Luke Nguyen, GRAIN offers visitors a unique culinary experience. Transfer from the port to the lively Ben Thanh Market where your guide will help you pick out the exotic vegetables, spices and herbs that will be used in today’s cooking lesson. After exploring the market, drive to the GRAIN cooking studio for your hands-on four-course cooking classes. Once you’ve finished your menu, savor each dish as you sit down to feast on the fruits of your labor. </p>\n<p>However you opt to spend your afternoon in the city, this evening we turn our attention to the cultural highlights. Attend a show in the elegant Saigon Opera House, a prominent building in Ho Chi Minh City. It is a perfect venue to watch the locally famous ‘A O’ show, a unique blend of bamboo cirque, acrobatics and theatrical visual. After enjoying a welcome drink in the foyer of this impressive building, settle down and enjoy the show. After the performance, chat with the director and cast. From here, continue to one of the best restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City, Cuc Gach, where a six course dinner of Vietnamese delicacies awaits.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 15 — Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</strong> <br />\nWith memories of Ancient Siam and Indochina fresh in mind, enjoy one more breakfast aboard before disembarking <em>Silver Discoverer. </em></p>\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 – Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Discoverer</em> in Ho Chi Minh City to start – Secrets of Vietnam and the Orient Sea. </p>\n<p>After settling in you will attend a mandatory safety drill before leaving port. This evening you will be introduced to important members of the crew and the Expedition Team. Get to know some of your fellow travellers over a sail away cocktail and enjoy the first of many memorable dinners in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 – Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nWith <em>Silver Discoverer</em> snuggly alongside in Ho Chi Minh City (or Saigon as it is locally known) we would like to offer you the choice of several unique opportunities for exploring the city. Perhaps you would like to start your morning with a morning Tai Chi session in one of the oldest parks in Ho Chi Minh City. With a 6:30 am start time, appreciate the early morning rays as you experience the morning like a local. After class, relax with a glass of the famous Vietnamese coffee, then jump in a rickshaw cyclo to visit a market. Stroll the stalls and see how local people shop for their daily groceries, meats and other exotic items.</p>\n<p>Starting slightly later in the morning, you will have the choice to set out on a tour exploring the highlights this vibrant city from the back of a motor scooter to travel as local people do daily. By scooter we will visit attractions such as a flower market and an atmospheric pagoda in Chinatown. Your driver will then zip you back to the city centre to visit the Notre Dame Cathedral. Next to the cathedral is the Grand Central Post Office, designed by Gustav Eiffel offering visitors a chance to imagine life in the time of the Indochinese Empire. Change to motor coaches for your final stop at Ben Thanh market, where you will enjoy a glass of Vietnamese coffee. </p>\n<p>Many travellers appreciate Vietnam’s rich history and the Cu Chi Tunnels are an incredible network of hundreds of miles of narrow tunnels that were built during resistance to the French colonization and utilized extensively during the Vietnam War. The tunnels give an amazing insight into life during the war. If you prefer using the day to dive into this history, join us on a guided exploration of Vietnam’s past.</p>\n<p>The day begins with a transfer from Ho Chi Minh City by speedboat along the banks of the Saigon River to meet a Vietnamese war veteran who will share his experiences of living in the tunnels with you. Before exploring the tunnels watch a short introductory film to gain a better understanding of the tunnel network. Some have been enlarged, so it is possible to go inside, but there is also so much to see above ground. After your exploration, stop for lunch at a local restaurant where you will meet a reputed United Press International photographer during the Vietnam War to gain a deeper understanding of Vietnam’s history.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, begin the day with a visit to the History Museum, set in the Zoo and Botanical Gardens. &nbsp;The Museum now houses artefacts illustrating the evolution of Vietnamese culture from ancient times to the 1930s, when Vietnam’s Communist Party was founded. Then visit the Reunification Palace built on the site of the former Norodom Palace. Continue to Notre Dame Cathedral and the classic 19th century French colonial Post Office. The largest post office in Vietnam, it is an important communications hub for city inhabitants.</p>\n<p>After lunch at local restaurant, explore Cholon, “Chinatown,” and a prosperous area that has been engaged in trading activities since the 17th century. Known for its Chinese delis, ancient quarters, old temples and pagodas, the area reflects original architecture and age-old rituals. Transfer to visit a Quan Am pagoda built in the 18th century. Unchanged for hundreds of years, the pagoda offers a serene escape from the bustling atmosphere of Chinatown. Meet with Dr. Duong Ngoc Dung to learn more about Vietnam culture and religions. </p>\n<p>In one final half-day offering for Saigon, learn the fundamentals of delicious Vietnamese cuisine from preparation to presentation at the GRAIN cooking school. Founded by local celebrity chef Luke Nguyen, GRAIN promises to offer visitors a unique culinary experience. Transfer from the port to the lively Ben Thanh Market where your guide will help you pick out the exotic vegetables, spices and herbs that will be used in today’s cooking lesson. After exploring the market, drive to the GRAIN cooking studio for your hands-on four-course cooking classes. Once you’ve finished your menu, savor each dish as you sit down to feast on the fruits of your labor. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 – Cruise the Tien River, Mekong Delta, Vietnam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nHo Chi Minh City (or Saigon as it is locally known) lies on the Saigon River, a tributary of the massive Mekong River delta. <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will spend the day cruising in the river system downstream to the sea. Join the Expedition Team out on deck as the ship navigates the bends of the river.&nbsp; Mangrove forests along the shore contain nipa palms, red mangroves, and swiftlet condominiums for the cultivation of lucrative birds’ nest soup.&nbsp; The morning’s passage will bring both small local fishing boats and large cargo vessels as they carry goods back and forth on this busy river system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Join the Expedition Team for any workshops or lectures that are offered today, and enhance your knowledge of Vietnam’s natural and cultural history.</p>\n<p><br />\n  <strong>Day 4 – Cai Be, Tien River, Mekong Delta, Vietnam&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n<em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor in the early morning hours in front of Cai Be, a small town of Tien Giang Province. Upon arrival you may choose to board a local boat and glide through the waterways of the Mekong Delta passing the floating market that sells everything from seasonal fruits to rice noodles for breakfast. Disembark at a local village where you will be able to visit one of the ancient houses. Enjoy refreshments while spending time with the owner of the property. The final stop will be at a local primary school where you can teach the children some English words while you brush up on your Vietnamese before returning to the ship at anchor.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you will be keen for an offering that gets you moving, in which case transfer by bus from the landing jetty to the small village that is home of the coveted, “Hoa Loc mango.” Here we will use bicycles to explore beautifully intimate roads that reveal traditional houses and the rhythms of daily life. Next, enjoy a boat cruise to An Binh Island to take a small rowboat deeper into the peaceful countryside on small canals. A short walk will bring you to a local house for a taste of some local snacks with hot tea.</p>\n<p>In several Mekong Delta provinces the local people preserve a traditional way of fishing in which they manually drain ditches to catch fish. Today you will have the option to work alongside local farmers who will teach you the art of \"Bailing ditches – Catching Fish.\" After boarding local boats, cruise to a nearby canal where the floating market of Cai Be takes place. Here you will visit a local house and be given a “bà ba” – a southern Vietnamese traditional dress – to wear. It is here, under the guidance of the locals that you will learn to bail ponds and catch fish. After your hard work, enjoy a well-deserved cup of tea and snacks, while listening to folk music. In this peaceful land, friends and neighbors often gather together to share moments like this.</p>\n<p>Once back aboard <em>Silver Discoverer</em>, the Captain and officers will chart a course for our next stop at Con Som, Vietnam. This gives us time to enjoy an afternoon at sea. Possibly you’ll opt to visit the gym, enjoy a relaxing appointment in the spa, or attend any number of lectures from the Expedition Team that will recap the highlights thus far and prepare you for the coming days in Vietnam.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 – Con Som, Vietnam </strong><br />\n  Sleep in today and perhaps attend a lecture presentation as we enjoy a morning at sea. Around lunchtime, <em>Silver Discoverer </em>will anchor outside of Con Dao, an area that had a reputation as a labor camp. Today, it is a place for the Vietnamese to remember and express their gratitude to fallen soldiers. </p>\n<p>Once ashore, we will use the afternoon to visit the Con Dao historical museum, where black and white photographs present a chilling reminder of the past. Next, visit the historical pier no. 914 where it is said 914 prisoners died while constructing the pier. Continue to Phu Hai and Phu Son prison, dating back to 1862 and the largest of the 11 jails on the island. Meet a local war veteran who will give you a personal insight into those trying times. Your final stop before returning to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> for the evening is Mrs. Phi Yen temple.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 – Day at Sea </strong><br />\nAs <em>Silver Discoverer</em> steams up the southern coast of Vietnam, members of the Expedition Team will be on the bridge and out on deck watching for seabirds or schools of feeding fish. Take advantage of the fresh air and boundless vistas and spend time with Silversea’s expert expedition team on deck, and of course inside, for a wealth of lecture presentations through the day.&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Qui Nhoh</strong><strong>, Vietnam</strong><br />\nToday you may choose to discover Qui Nhon, a city of around 300,000 people, through its history and culture with a visit to the Quang Trung Museum. On arrival you will be met by the museum’s curator and ladies in traditional “ao dai” dress offering flowers. Wander through the displays of costumes, documents, artefacts and various statues before watching a demonstration of Vo Binh Dinh martial art in which participants fight using bamboo sticks. Continue to the Twin Towers, which have a unique architecture of both Cham peoples. A visit to the tower is a chance to learn more about the ancient Cham culture of the region.</p>\n<p>If you prefer a sampling of the local nature, join our expedition team for a more slow paced morning on Hon Ngang Island. After transferring from the mainland by local boat, spend time on this tiny, private island. Enjoy a picnic on the beach, relax, and take in the tranquil ocean panorama. Wander around your private island, take a cool swim if you like, indulge in a bit of sunbathing, or a spot of snorkelling. Feeling fully refreshed we will board our local boats once more the journey back to the mainland.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Da Nang, Vietnam</strong><br />\nFrom our berth in the busy port, you may like to discover the highlights of Da Nang on a half-day tour and save the afternoon for independent exploration of this city and its colonial architecture. Da Nang boasts tree-lined boulevards with sidewalk cafes and old colonial villas. On the tour, visit a renowned Lady Buddha and tour the Cham Museum with a celebrated lecturer followed by a rickshaw cyclo ride around the city, with a stop at the lively Han Market. We continue to the Marble Mountains where  both the Vietnamese and the Cham used these mountains to build shrines, making it a picturesque spot with numerous grottoes, caves and pagodas.</p>\n<p>An alternative offering for you today is a visit to Hoi An, a quiet and tranquil town and UNESCO World Heritage Site, located south of Da Nang. Stroll the quaint town and local market to arrive at ‘The Market’ restaurant to sample local foods. Later join the cooking demonstration designed by a talented chef and authority on Vietnamese cuisine. &nbsp;Once your culinary skills have been honed, sit back and relax over the lunch that you have just cooked.</p>\n<p>The best way to visit Hoi An is on foot, and so we also offer a walking tour of the city that visits Hoi An’s historic town houses, assembly halls, and a Ceramic Museum where we will be guided by an expert in the conservation of the ancient town. <br /><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>  In the spirit of adventure, we present another option to vist Tra Que, a charming little village close to Hoi An – by bicycle. At the village, in the home of your host, there will be welcome drinks and freshly picked fruits. Explore the charming village to learn about its history and customs and join in traditional farming methods picking vegetables and herbs, and learning how to wrap them to prevent damage. Your host will offer a cooking demonstration with the family. Try your hand at making the village’s special spring rolls. Lunch will be made from the fruits of your labor.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Dong My, Vietnam</strong><br />\n<em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor off Dong My early this morning for what promises to be another busy morning of exploring the Vietnamese coast.&nbsp; Here we offer three caving options.&nbsp; The first is to Paradise Cave located inside the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park containing the oldest karst mountains in Asia. Transfer from the quayside by bus and then buggy to reach the entrance of Paradise Cave, which measures 31 km in length. Ornate natural stalactites and pillars skirt wooden walkways through the cave’s many chambers. At its largest the cave is 100 meters high and 150 meters wide. After exploring Paradise Cave, stop at a local lakeside resort for light refreshments before heading back to Dong My and <em>Silver Discoverer</em>. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps opt to visit Phong Nha Cave in the Ke Bang Forest instead. This cave is 7.7 km long with 14 grottos and a 14 km long underground river. &nbsp;The journey to reach the cave will require &nbsp;a 30 minute journey by small boat to the mouth of the cave. Gliding into the cave you will marvel at the stalagmites and stalactites and enjoy some time to explore with your guide and expedition team. </p>\n<p>Afterwards we visit the house of Mr Ho Khanh who stumbled upon Son Doong Cave in the cave system, but for years he could not find it again. After many expeditions the cave was re-discovered and since then Khanh has been a guide for researchers exploring caves in the area. Spend some time at his homestay and chat with him over a refreshing beer.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you are a real cave enthusiast, you may want to intimately explore another part of the cave system. The ‘Dark Cave’ is 5.5 km long and 80 meters high and is still without lights to spoil the experience. You will access the entrance to the cave from a tower by zip line. Once inside, there is a trek and a swim to a bathing pool of mud before kayaking back across the river and cleaning off. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Cat Ba Island, Ha Long Bay, Vietnam</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\nLocated in the Gulf of Tonkin, Ha Long Bay is one of the world's outstanding natural wonders, resembling a geographic work of art with thousands of limestone islets soaring dramatically from the clear emerald waters. This densely concentrated zone of karst islands, world famous for its spectacular scenery of grottoes and caves, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>\n<p>With <em>Silver Discoverer</em> at anchor in the heart of the bay, you may choose to board a traditional junk, sit back and relax as she sails into Halong Bay and the limestone cliffs and emerald waters. Transfer from your junk into smaller rowing boats to see how local fishermen and their families live on the water. Return to your junk and continue to Me Cung cave, where you will disembark with time to explore this underground wonderland. Return to the ship for lunch with new memories and an appreciation for the beauty and simplicity of life here. </p>\n<p>Perhaps being a bit more active is suited to your tastes and you would like to board a traditional junk to travel through Halong Bay and deep in the bay transfer into kayaks. Paddle and explore spectacular caves known as Dark and Bright Cave. The caves are formed by an enclosed group of islands which create a protected sea lake with only one small entrance. Return to your junk to continue to Me Cung Cave. After a good paddle, and a caving adventure, return to the ship for lunch.</p>\n<p>One final shorter offering is a visit to Cat Ba Island, covered in large part by national park. Begin with a visit to Hospital Cave, which served both as a secret, bomb-proof hospital during the fighting and as a safe house for VC leaders. Continue to explore the National park of Cat Ba Island on foot before a coach ride to pay a visit to the local market and Cannon Fort Hill where there are spectacular views over the bay. Finally, transfer back to the ship for lunch aboard. </p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Day at Sea</strong></p>\n<p><em>Silver Discoverer</em> bids farewell to Vietnam and sets a course for China’s shores. While travel with Silversea Expeditions is primarily about the excitement and delight to be found in exploring remote and infrequently visited corners of the world, it remains that you travel with a company renowned for its attention to detail and offering some of the most exemplary service available at sea today.&nbsp; Perhaps a sea day is your opportunity to enjoy a late breakfast served in the privacy and comfort of your suite. Later, you may choose to join new friends for a long leisurely lunch, or savor a sunset cocktail on the aft deck as the sun slips below the horizon. Sea days also present a perfect opportunity to enjoy a workout in the gym, indulge in a massage, or visit the salon. In essence, time at sea with us is time to get spoiled.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Days 12-13 – Shenzhen, China</strong><br />\nDisembark <em>Silver Discoverer </em>in Shenzhen with an overnight bag and transfer to the train station bound for the inland region of Guilin. A boxed lunch will be arranged on the train for you to enjoy as the magnificent scenery reveals itself around you. Once in the karst peaks of the Guilin region and the town of Sanjian, we will have a half day for sightseeing. Today will be an experience of the wisdom and great creativity of the region’s Dong people, from a traditional village, to tonight’s special dinner known as the, \"Hundred Families Banquet.\" This style of feast is listed as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage and holds great significance for the Dong people. Following dinner we travel to Sanjiang county for a Dong performance and the Sanjiang Dong Xiang Hotel, where we spend the night.</p>\n<p>The following morning we continue our exploration of the Guilin region with a visit to the Sanjiang Tea Plantation. The owner of the plantation will personally meet us to show us the property and explain the tea drying process. A traditional lunch of the Guangxi people will be arranged and following that we will drive back to Sanjiang train station and return to the city of Shenzhen with dinner aboard the train.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, disembark the ship in Shenzhen and travel overland by train to Guilin. From here we will drive to Yangshuo, Guangxi Province for lunch at a local restaurant. After sampling the local foods, we begin our exploration of the Yangshuo countryside by bicycle. With single and tandem bikes available, you are sure to relish the ride through the picturesque landscape, farmlands and country roads of Yangshuo county. From the end point of our bicycle tour we then transfer to the Green Lotus Hotel to get ready for the evening’s activities. Once assembled, we will transfer by boat to a peaceful and pretty island beside the Li River for a “Bonfire Party.” Dinner will be served beside the river bank and after dinner, delight in local dancing, singing and interactive local games.</p>\n<p>After checking out of the hotel this morning we will transfer to Yangshuo and enjoy a morning of sightseeing. You will have the choice to raft on the Yulong River or visit the Yangshuo Moon Hill Scenic Area. Rafting on the Yulong River will allow us to travel on a bamboo raft with reclining chairs down the meandering river lined by green bamboo and rolling hills. Local people use bamboo rafts as daily transportation up and down the river between their houses, markets, and rice paddies. Enjoy a panoramic river and steep karst hills as we ride the waters down the river.</p>\n<p>If you would like to spend a little more time on terra firma this morning, you may opt to take a trip to the time-honored town of Xingping. Nestled at the foot of the steep, conical mountains near the meandering Li River, the ancient town is celebrated in China for its natural scenery and heritage. From here, board a local boat for a trip downstream to Yangshouo on the Li River. In Yangshouo, we will come ashore for lunch at a local restaurant and then drive to the Yangshuo Moon Hill Scenic Area. Moon Hill stands at more than 380 meters high with a crescent-shaped hole through the upper portion of the mountain. When the light shines through the hole just so; it appears like the moon, high and bright. Peeling ourselves away from the stunning terrain of this region, we will transfer back by train (with dinner served as we travel) to the <em>Silver Discoverer</em> in her berth in Shenzhen.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 — Hong Kong</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 – Hong Kong, China</strong><br />\n  Embark the <em>Silver Discoverer</em> for this delightful Silversea Expedition across the South China and Philippine Seas, “Ancient Island Nations of the Western Pacific.” This afternoon, you will attend a safety briefing before leaving Hong Kong. <strong></strong></p>\n<p>At sail away watch Hong Kong’s skyline recede in our little ship’s churning wake. Later, important members of the crew will be introduced, as well as your Expedition Team. We invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and in the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 – At Sea</strong><br />\nWhile <em>Silver Discoverer</em> sails across the South China Sea in a south-easterly direction, take this day to settle in and relax. Perhaps enjoy a leisurely breakfast and then join our lecturers for talks about the Philippines. Topics might range from the archipelago’s colonial time to the 20th century, its modern history, but above all its natural history and the attractions we intend to visit.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 – Vigan, Philippines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nAs we land in Salomague, on Luzon’s northwestern shore, we will be welcomed by a local band before heading south to Vigan and its historical district. We will see the Bantay Church and bell tower, Ilocos’ oldest structures dating back to 1590. A Filipino style “fiesta” lunch will be had in a beautiful garden known as the Hidden Garden. This will also include a demonstration of how to prepare Pinakbet –a popular northern dish of mixed vegetables steamed in fish or shrimp sauce. Later a pottery factory specializing in jars is visited and we will ride in horse-drawn carriages to the Syquia Mansion, a museum dedicated to the Philippines’ sixth President. A walk through the Vigan Heritage Village with its mestizo district of old colonial, Spanish-style houses and tasting of local delicacies will end the excursion. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 – Aparri, Luzon, Philippines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nWe will depart from the pier and drive along Luzon’s northern shore to Santa Ana. There we will have several options. You might want to swim at beautiful Anguib Beach, swim and explore at the Boacag Waterfalls or might decide to take a local boat across to Palaui Island for a hike to its northern cape and a lighthouse at Cape Deception.&nbsp; Located south of the lighthouse is Engaño (Deception) Cove, offering the opportunity for swimming. </p>\n<p>Returning to Aparri at sunset there will still be some time for souvenir shopping. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 – Sabtang, Philippines</strong><br />\nArriving quite early in the Philippines’ northernmost province, we will want to make the most of our visit to Sabtang Island. After our Zodiac landing there will be a cultural presentation with traditional songs and dances. At Morong Beach there will be nice photo opportunities of the beach and arc, as well as food demonstrations and tasting. Further photo opportunities will be at Savidug Village and the Chamantad Tinyan View Point. A short nature walk and a guided tour at the “Vakul” weavers, who produce the traditional head gear for women, will conclude with a walking tour of the Chavayan Village with its characteristic Ivatan vernacular houses. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>  In the afternoon <em>Silver Discoverer</em> sails north across the Philippine Sea. Our lecturers will want to prepare you for our visit to Japan with talks or seminars. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 – Ishigaki-Jima, Japan </strong><br />\nDuring the morning, while <em>Silver Discoverer</em> approaches the Yaeyama Islands, there will be time for more lectures or a seminar. </p>\n<p>At Ishigaki-Jima we will clear into Japan, and after lunch we hope to disembark onto Ishigaki Island. From here we board a ferry for the short ride to Taketomi Jima. Taketomi’s specialty is a village occupied by a few hundred people whose way of life has little changed from times gone by. After a short guided walk there is a chance to explore on our own. </p>\n<p>  For birders the Ijima’s and Japanese Leaf Warblers might be of interest. If you like ice cream, Japan might surprise you. Taketomi offers several flavours that not common, and mong them is a lavender-coloured sweet potato offering. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Miyako-Jima, Japan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nRoughly 320 km southwest of the main island of Okinawa, Miyako-Jima Island is the largest of the eight islands of the Miyako Island Chain. The island bears many historical relics and beautiful white sandy beaches including Maehama, Painagama, Sunakawa, and Shigira Beach.</p>\n<p>  A scenic drive across the island will take us to the Iruma Ohashi Bridge, the longest fee toll and sea bridge in Japan. The bridge is a work of art that took nine years to complete and resembles a dragon’s tail from a distance. At our next destination we will board a small boat bound for a nearby coral reef to look for fish and turtles. Below decks the boat has large windows and seats for underwater viewing of fish cruising past the reef at close quarters. Hundreds of fish from many species can be observed along with possible sightings of green turtles – all viewed from a uniquely different perspective.</p>\n<p>  Another destination is Hennazaki Cape where there are great views of the ocean and a stately lighthouse. It is mesmerizing to stand and watch the swell while appreciating the power of the ocean.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Naha, Okinawa, Japan </strong><br />\n  Okinawa is a typical Japanese subtropical region with a warm climate where cherry blossoms bloom in late January, and the swimming season lasts from April to October. There are more than sixty islands between the main island of Okinawa in the North and Yonaguni Island at the south-western end.<br />\nDeparting from the pier and travelling towards the southeast corner of Okinawa, the first stop will be at the former Japanese Navy Underground Headquarters. One can walk down the 101 steps into the narrow tunnels to get a unique insight into the conditions and experiences of the soldiers and officers inside the headquarters. </p>\n<p>Shuri Castle, our next stop, is the administrative center and residence of the Ryukyu royal family for over 400 years. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the castle rests on a hill providing outstanding views of Naha and the sea. Surrounded by tall curved walls, the bright red castle is a mixture of Japanese and Chinese architectural styles. You will see the lavishly decorated Main Hall and the ornate Shurei Gate. Known as the Gate of Courtesy, it typifies Okinawan architecture and serves as a symbol of modern day Okinawa. </p>\n<p>The final stop will be Shikina-en Garden, constructed in the end of the 18th century; it features beautiful, relatively simple, wooden palace buildings with Okinawan-style, red tile roofs and a spacious Japanese-style landscape garden. A section of the old stone pavement that ran from the Shuri Palace to Shikina-en still exists. While the garden is designed in a style seen elsewhere in Japan, the architecture and flora of Shikina-en are uniquely Okinawan. Although the original garden was destroyed during World War II, it has been beautifully restored.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Amami, Oshima, Japan</strong><br />\nAmami Oshima is an unspoilt natural paradise situated in the Amami islands and surrounded by transparent waters with brightly coloured coral reefs and tropical fish. Our day will start with a visit to Oshimatsumugi Kimono village where we can watch the process of making tsumugi and kasuri silk-cotton fabrics. This is a craft complex in a beautiful hillside setting among flowers and many of the plants used in the process of dyeing. </p>\n<p>In Bashayama Village enjoy lunch including Keihan, one of the specialities in Amami. Keihan consists of chicken, egg and other various ingredients placed on rice and covered in chicken broth. During lunch we will also have a chance to see local people playing the Shamisen. After lunch, we can relax at the beautiful beach or stroll through Kenmunmura village with its traditional houses.</p>\n<p>If you prefer a visit with a little more activity, then choose the canoeing tour in Amami Oshima’s Mangrove Park. Amami Oshima holds Japan’s second-largest mangrove forest and is inhabited by the Amami Rabbit, a national protected species. You will canoe for about one hour amongst the mangroves.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 10 — Yakushima, Japan</strong><br />\nYakushima, Japan’s first UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993, is famous in botanical circles for its great many garden plants, including dwarf plants which have evolved to grow smaller than their mainland cousins. We will spend time on nature walks including Yakusugi Land, a nature park populated by a number of the island’s ancient cedar trees, including the Buddhasugi (a 2500-year-old cedar), Futagosugi and Sennensugi. There are different trails for different levels of activity and while walking, we will see the very clear stream running through the forest and the unique plant life on the island. There will also be a chance to see Yaku Monkey and Yaku Deer.</p>\n<p>After your walk in the forest you will visit the Yakusugi Museum, which tells about the vegetation of Yakusugi, as well as the history of Yakushima.</p>\n<p>In the evening attend the Videographer’s presentation of our voyage documentary.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 —Nagasaki,&nbsp;Japan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nFollowing breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1- Nagasaki, Japan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Embark&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer</em>&nbsp;and depart on your exciting Silversea Expedition – “Journey in the Land of the Rising Sun”. After settling in you will attend a safety briefing and be introduced to your Expedition Team.&nbsp; Weather permitting we will have a Sail-away Cocktail on deck.</p>\n<p>We invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant. An aperitif will permit you to relax after your travels towards&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 - Jeju, South Korea</strong></p><p>\n  Located off the south coast of mainland Korea, Jeju Island’s natural, geological and cultural attractions are well known in Japan and Korea. The dormant volcano Hallasan stands 1,950 meters above sea level and is a UNESCO Biosphere reserve containing a crater lake, alpine plants, woodpeckers and butterflies. At another UNESCO Geopark, the Manjang cave is more than eight kilometers long and you can walk one kilometer of its eerie passageway. From a lush, ambling south coast route overlooking craggy islands, one can use coastal trails around much of the island, including to reach the sea over strange rock formations and see the caves that islanders were forced to dig by Japanese occupiers to hide weapons. Dry-stone walls protect fields from storms. Around the year 1750,&nbsp;masons started carving rocks into forbidding black \"grandfather stones\" to scare off invaders. Forty-five of these massive statues still exist. The stones remain a symbol of a distinct ancient culture furnished with many gods and legends. When we arrive in late March the yellow canola flowers should form spectacular sceneries, although it might be a little too early for the cherry blossoms to flower fully. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 - Busan, South Korea</strong> </p><p>Today we visit Gyeongju, 1.5 hours north of Busan. The modern city of Gyeongju is often called “the museum without walls”, and its historical area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here the southern part of Korea was first unified under the Silla Kingdom and many archaeological remains can be seen in the area. First we stop at the Bulguksa Temple, a grand centrepiece of a religious architectural complex of exceptional significance. Bulguksa is considered a masterpiece of Far Eastern Buddhist Art and has been inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List since the temple complex is both an outstanding example of religious architecture of the region and the material expression of Buddhist belief.<br />\n  After lunch at a local hotel we continue to Daeneungwon. This is a Tumuli Park with more than 20 tombs from the Silla period. Most of the tombs are grass-covered mounds, creating a spectacular scene which resembles a small mountain range. Depending on the season, the park’s mounds take on different colours. One of the burial mounds can be visited and one can appreciate the painting of a heavenly horse that was found during the tomb’s excavation. Our final stop will be at the Gyeongju Traditional Cultural Institute to witness and experience a series of various cultural traditions. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 - Moji, Japan</strong></p><p>From Moji we will drive to Kokura, the financial and business capital of this area. Kokura’s landmark is its castle, which has been beautifully restored. In addition to Kokura Castle, we will stroll the small but remarkable garden located next to the main castle. Some of the best photos of the castle can be taken from this garden.</p><p>After lunch at a local restaurant we will see the Hiraodai Limestone Plateau, Japan’s most representative karst plateau. Approaching the area one could mistake the pure white limestone scattered throughout the landscape for sheep grazing in the grass. A “Natural Treasure” the plateau has underground caves as well. We will explore Hiraodai Senbutsu Cave accompanied by local guides. To get deep into the cave you will have to walk in the stream running through the cave.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miyajima and Hiroshima, Japan</strong></p><p>In the morning, visit the small island of Miyajima (“The Shrine Island”) and get to see one of “The Three Most Beautiful Views” of Japan: the Floating Torii Gate. Built in the water, the Torii Gate leads to the Itsukushima Shrine and at high tide it seems to float. The Torii Gate is one of the most photographed sites in all of Japan. To reach the shrine we will have to walk as a group for slightly more than 1 kilometre. There are more shrines and paths on Miyajima that invite &nbsp;you to walk. Mount Misen has a cable car leading partly up to the top with nice views and wild monkeys and deer roaming the trails.<br />\n  During the afternoon, we will visit Hiroshima, a name linked to the dropping of the Atomic Bomb and the end of World War II. We will drive to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in central Hiroshima. The area where the park lies was Ground Zero for the Atomic Bomb on August 6, 1945. The park is dedicated to those who lost their lives in the attack. The park has many memorials and monuments, and we will stroll through it before we visit the Peace Memorial Museum. The museum surveys the history of Hiroshima and the advent of the nuclear bomb, focusing on the events of August 6 and the human suffering as a result of the bomb.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 - Hagi, Japan</strong></p><p>From the port we drive to Hagi’s “Old Town.” The tour will take you to Shizukiyama Park and Hagi Castle. Based around the ruins of Hagi Castle there will be some 600 Yoshino cherry trees in bloom. After the park and castle ruin visit we will reach a Samurai Quarter, which preserves the traditional style Japanese houses and old-fashioned streets. You will be taken to one of the old houses and will see how the Japanese lived in traditional ways. The house shows the typical interior of a Japanese residence. You will also have free time in the area, to wander around this charming district on your own.</p><p>After visiting the Samurai quarter, the next stop will be at Tokoji Temple. This is a temple of the Obaku-shu school of Zen Buddhism and is the resting place of the two first Mori daimyo -a family of powerful and territorial pre-modern Japanese lords. The main gate, the triple gate, the bell tower and the main hall have been listed on the National Register of Important Cultural Properties. Yoshinari Mōri and all odd-numbered generations of Mōri lords up to the 11th generation, their wives, children and those close to them in life are buried in the cemetery of the Mōri clan behind the main hall building. Facing these tombs stand more than 500 stone lanterns, donated by later generations of the Hagi Clan.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 - Sakaiminato, Japan</strong></p><p>Inland from Sakaiminato the towns of Matsue and Yasugi offer very different, yet in their way traditional experiences: Matsue is known as the “Town of Water” next to scenic Lake Shinji and Lake Nakanoumi. Matsue has one of the very few wooden castles that still remain in Japan. Apart from touring the castle and enjoying magnificent views of Lake Shinji you can also use the opportunity to do a boat ride on the Horikawa River and the castle’s moat.</p><p>Yasugi has the Adachi Museum of Art, a private museum that houses one of the finest collections of contemporary Japanese paintings, but also has a 165,000 square metres garden –with plants and rocks collected by the museum’s founder. Six different gardens will show different scenarios depending on the season. Under the motto that “the Japanese garden is like a living picture” these gardens have been selected as ‘Japan’s best garden’ for several years. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 -&nbsp;Oki Island, Japan</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>\n  The Oki Archipelago consists of about 180 large and small islands. Many Japanese visit these romantic islands because of the historic places and old tradition.&nbsp;There are two excursions that will visit Yurahime Shrine, known as a guardian of the sea. When the goddess Yurahime-no-mikoto was crossing the see in a tub and washed her hands with sea water, a squid bit her hand. Since then, a large school of squids surge to the seashore before the shrine in autumn to express their regret. Squids swimming in the sea are depicted on the upper wall of the main hall of the shrine, an object d'art of squid is in the precinct and telephone boxes of squid-form are along the approach. Squids are everywhere in the shrine. </p><p>After making a photo stop at Akao Lookout, you will then be transferred to Matengai Cliff where you start a 2 km hike along the coast or just enjoy the panoramic views. Matengai Cliff is a sheer cliff rising 257 m above sea level. The cliff top is a smooth meadow with a well-maintained walking path. If you decide to walk, you will enjoy the magnificent view of Kuniga Coast. </p><p>Returning to the ship after excursions, you will also enjoy a scenic cruise along Kuniga Coast.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 - Maizuru, Japan</strong><br />\n  Today we will drive inland toward Kyoto, renowned for spectacular architecture. Our first visit will be at Nijo Castle, a fortification of cypress wood built in 1603 as the residence of the Tokugawa clan. A UNESCO World Heritage site, the castle is protected by a moat, stone walls, and ingenious nightingale floors, which chirp like a bird when walked upon to alert the guards of potential intruders. Despite its defensive elements, the castle was primarily a home. It is adorned with wooden carvings, artistically painted sliding doors and expansive tatami rooms. </p><p>After enjoying Japanese lunch, you will be transferred to Kyoto's most famous landmark, Kinkakuji Temple (Golden Pavilion). Built by Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu as a villa in 1397, the three-story home was converted to a temple by Yoshimitsu's son. The Golden Pavilion is positioned at the edge of a tranquil pond. The three-story Chinese-influenced Golden Pavilion has delicately curving roofs, with the walls and eaves of the second and third stories covered in shimmering gold leaf. View the exterior of the pavilion and walk through the peaceful gardens, marveling at the mirror reflection of the temple on the still pond. While in Kyoto we will see that this is the peak for the cherry blossom in the city’s gardens and parks.</p><p>The last highlight of the day will be Arashiyama, a pleasant district in the western outskirts of Kyoto. Okochi Mountain Villa consists of several beautiful gardens and buildings, including living quarters, tea houses and a Zen meditation hall. Take a walk through Arashiyama’s famous bamboo groves, which are particularly attractive when there is a light wind and the tall bamboo stalks sway gently back and forth. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 – Kanazawa, Japan&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Art in various forms will be today’s theme, as Kanazawa is known for its lacquer ware, Kutani-style pottery, gold-leaf workmanship and delicately painted silk kimonos. In addition to these purchasable products, Kanazawa has “Kenrokuen,” one of the most famous gardens in Japan. Located next to Kanazawa Castle, “Kenrokuen” is classified as, “One of the Three Gardens of Japan.”</p><p>Our tour will start with a visit to the Omi-cho Market with its many lively local seafood stalls, before we will take our time to walk through “Kenrokuen.” The garden has an artificial pond, and hills and houses are dotted within the 11.4 hectares. It has Japan’s oldest fountain using natural water pressure and a tea-house dating back to 1774. After the visit of the garden, you will enjoy lunch and Geisha performance at a local restaurant.</p><p>In the afternoon a visit to the Higashi Chaya Gai Geisha District (designated a National Cultural Asset) will permit us to see the biggest of the Geisha district of Kanazawa. Some of the houses not only retain the original structure, but still are used as Geisha houses. Some of the streets have traditional shops creating a nostalgic atmosphere. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 11&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sado Island, Japan</strong></p><p>Sado is Japan’s sixth-largest island and depends mainly on fishing and agriculture (rice-production). Today will be a day of unusual highlights as we will visit Tori Forest Park to see the successful “reintroduction” of Crested Ibises into Japan.&nbsp; The ibis species was believed to have a total world population of 12 birds in 1981. At that time, the last five wild ibises found in Japan were taken into captivity on Sado and both Japan and China cooperated in a breeding programme for these birds. Fortunately, the work has paid off thus far, and released Crested Ibises successfully nested in the wild again in 2012. </p><p>Before we return to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> the Sado Gold Mine can be visited. For the adventurous a descent into the deep tunnels will show the conditions under which gold was extracted for almost 400 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12&nbsp;&nbsp; - Niigata, Japan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n  After breakfast disembark&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer.</em><br />\n</p>\n<p><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

This afternoon, you will attend a safety briefing before leaving Kobe. Later on, important members of the crew will be introduced, as well as your Expedition Team.</p>\n<p>  We invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and in the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>  At dinnertime <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will head for the Harima-nada Sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 –Okayama, Japan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nA day of diverse cultural experiences awaits us, as we will head for one of Japan’s most significant gardens. Although the “Korakuen” Garden was severely damaged in WWII, the descriptions and paintings from the Edo period permitted an exact reconstruction. Designed in the “Kaiyu” style it is one of the “Three Gardens of Japan” and has been designated a “Special Scenic Location.” We will have time to stroll through the garden and taste Japanese Green Tea – a specialty of the area.<strong></strong></p>\n<p>  Lunch will be served at a local restaurant before we continue to Kurashiki, a town known as the centre of rice-distribution in the Okayama area. Many old warehouses next to the preserved canal have been converted into museums, boutiques and cafes.<br />\nThe Ohara Museum, which we are going to see during the afternoon, was the first Japanese Museum to permanently exhibit Western Art. We can see an eclectic mix of paintings and objects by El Greco, Renoir, Gauguin, Pisarro, Degas, Monet, Toulouse-Lautrec, Matisse, Rodin, and Picasso, as well as pieces from Jackson Pollock, de Chirico and Jasper Johns. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 – Takamatsu, Japan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nTakamatsu is located on Shikoku, the smallest of the four main Japanese Islands. </p>\n<p>  Your day will start with the visit to Ritsurin Garden. The 75-hectare park features six ponds, thirteen hills, a waterfall, plum, cherry, and pine trees, a bamboo forest, a tea house, and more. The garden is recognized one of the most beautiful strolling gardens in Japan and was awarded three stars in the Michelin Green Guide Japan.<br />\n  The Japanese cuisine is famous for its sushi and noodles and today you can try an Udon making experience. Not only will you learn how to prepare them, but you will also have a chance to taste the Udon noodles you just made!<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 4 – Miyajima and Hiroshima, Japan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nDuring the morning we will visit the small island of Miyajima (“The Shrine Island”) and get to see one of “The Three Most Beautiful Views” of Japan: the Floating Torii Gate. Built in the water, the Torii Gate leads to the Itsukushima Shrine and at high tide it seems to float. The Torii Gate is one of the most photographed sites in all of Japan. There are many more shrines and path on Miyajima that invite to be walked. Mount Misen has cable car leading partly up to the top with nice views and wild monkeys and deer roaming the trails.</p>\n<p>  The name Hiroshima is linked to the dropping of the Atomic Bomb and the end of World War II. We will drive to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in central Hiroshima. The area where the park lies was Ground Zero for the Atomic Bomb on August 6, 1945. The park is dedicated to those who lost their lives in the attack. The park has many memorials and monuments, and we will stroll through it before we visit the Peace Memorial Museum. The museum surveys the history of Hiroshima and the advent of the nuclear bomb, focusing on the events of August 6.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 – Moji, Japan</strong><br />\n  From Moji we will drive to Kokura, the financial and business capital of this area. Kokura’s landmark is its castle, which has been beautifully restored. In addition to visiting Kokura Castle, we will stroll the remarkable garden located next to the main castle.</p><p>After lunch we will see the Hiraodai Limestone Plateau, Japan’s most representative karst plateau. Approaching the area one could mistake the pure white limestone scattered throughout the landscape for sheep grazing in the grass. Truly a natural treasure, the plateau also contains underground caves. We will explore Hiraodai Senbutsu Cave accompanied by local guides. To get deep into the cave you will have to walk in the stream running through the cave.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 – Kumamoto, Japan </strong><br />\n  Built in the early 17th century, the Kumamoto Castle is one of the three most famous castles of Japan. The castle has a number of interesting features, such as a stone wall and the beautiful black and white castle tower. However, it is the 800 cherry trees that add unrivalled elegance to the castle. The main varieties are Yoshino cherry as well as mountain cherry trees and Higo-zakura which make the square in front of the castle tower and the front of the long wall a wonderful spot for cherry blossom viewing, which we hope to still see in mid-April. This vast castle area is also a cultural place, and houses the Kumamoto Prefectural Museum of Art, the Kumamoto City Museum, and the Botanical Garden. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Yakushima, Japan</strong><br />\n  Yakushima, Japan’s first UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993, is famous in botanical circles for its great many garden plants, including dwarf plants which have evolved to grow smaller than their mainland cousins. </p>\n<p>  We will spend time on nature walks including Yakusugi Land, a nature park populated by a number of the island’s ancient cedar trees, including the Buddhasugi (a 2500-year-old cedar), Futagosugi and Sennensugi. There are different trails for different levels of activity and while walking, we will see the very clear stream running through the forest and the unique plant life on the island. There will also be a chance to see Yaku Monkey and Yaku Deer.</p>\n<p>  After your walk in the forest you will visit the Yakusugi Museum, which tells about the vegetation of Yakusugi, as well as the history of Yakushima.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Amami, Oshima, Japan</strong><br />\nAmami Oshima is an unspoilt natural paradise situated in the Amami islands and surrounded by transparent waters with brightly coloured coral reefs and tropical fish. Our day will start with a visit to Oshimatsumugi Kimono village where we can watch the process of making tsumugi and kasuri silk-cotton fabrics. This is a craft complex in a beautiful hillside setting among flowers and many of the plants used in the process of dyeing. </p>\n<p>  In Bashayama Village we will have lunch including Keihan -one of the best specialities in Amami, Keihan consists of chicken, egg and other various ingredients placed on rice and covered in chicken broth. During lunch we will also have a chance to see local people playing the Shamisen. </p>\n<p>  After lunch, we can relax at the beautiful beach or stroll through Kenmunmura village with its traditional houses.</p>\n<p>If you prefer a visit with a little more activity, then choose the canoeing tour in Amami Oshima’s Mangrove Park. Amami Oshima holds Japan’s second-largest mangrove primeval forest –inhabited by the Amami Rabbit, a national protected species. You will be canoeing for approximately an hour amongst the mangroves.&nbsp; <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 9 — Naha, Okinawa, Japan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  Okinawa is a typical Japanese subtropical region with a warm climate where cherry blossoms bloom in late January, and the swimming season lasts from April to October. There are more than sixty islands between the main island of Okinawa in the North and Yonaguni Island at the south-western end.<br />\n  Departing from the pier and travelling towards the southeast corner of Okinawa, the first stop will be at the former Japanese Navy Underground Headquarters. One can walk down the 101 steps into the narrow tunnels to get a unique insight into the conditions and experiences of the soldiers and officers inside the headquarters. </p><p>Then we will visit Shuri Castle, the administrative center and residence of the Ryukyu royal family for over 400 years. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the castle rests on a hill providing outstanding views of Naha and the sea. Surrounded by tall curved walls, the bright red castle is a mixture of Japanese and Chinese architectural styles. You will see the lavishly decorated Main Hall and the ornate Shurei Gate. Known as the Gate of Courtesy, it typifies Okinawan architecture and serves as a symbol of modern day Okinawa. </p><p>The final stop will be Shikina-en Garden, constructed in the end of the 18th century; it features beautiful, relatively simple, wooden palace buildings with Okinawan-style, red tile roofs and a spacious Japanese-style landscape garden. A section of the old stone pavement that ran from the Shuri Palace to Shikina-en still exists. While the garden is designed in a style seen elsewhere in Japan, the architecture and flora of Shikina-en are uniquely Okinawan. Although the original garden was destroyed during World War II, it has been beautifully restored.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — At Sea &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nWhile <em>Silver Discoverer</em> sails south, our lecturers will recap the Japanese experiences and will prepare you for the interesting ports to be visited in the Philippines.</p>\n<p>  The Executive Chef, and his or her team, would like to demonstrate how to prepare some of the culinary specialties they have chosen for your dining experiences and you might want to try cooking your own fish or meat at the Hot Rocks dining experience out on deck this evening. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Batan Island, Philippines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nDuring the morning <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will continue to sail south across the Philippine Sea. </p>\n<p>  Have a leisurely breakfast, join a seminar or workshop, and get ready for our first stop in the Philippines’ northernmost province.&nbsp; Arriving in the late morning, we have to clear into the Philippines, and then will want to make the most of our visit to Batan Island. </p><p>Upon arrival there will be a cultural presentation with traditional songs and dances. We will see traditional houses and hear about their importance.&nbsp; In addition, be ready to reach lookout points and at the Basco Lighthouse enjoy a food demonstration and tasting. Further stops and photo opportunities will be at Chawa, the Valugan Boulder Bay and Rakuh A Payaman (known locally as Marlboro Country for the communal pasture). &nbsp;Another cooking demo and tasting of local delicacies, specifically the various ways to prepare sweet potatoes, will take place before we return to the pier and <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 – Vigan, Philippines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nAs we land in Salomague, on Luzon’s northwestern shore, we will be welcomed by a local band before heading south to Vigan and its historical district. We will see the Bantay Church and bell tower that is one of Ilocos’ oldest structures dating back to 1590. A Filipino style “fiesta” lunch will be had in a beautiful garden known as the Hidden Garden. There will also be a demonstration of how to prepare Pinakbet, which is a popular northern dish of mixed vegetables steamed in fish or shrimp sauce. Following these activities, visit a pottery factory specializing in jars and ride in horse-drawn carriages to the Syquia Mansion, a museum dedicated to the Philippines’ sixth President. A walk through the Vigan Heritage Village with its mestizo district of old colonial, Spanish-style houses and tasting of local delicacies will end the excursion before we head back to the <em>Silver Discoverer</em> after a full day ashore.&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 – Hundred Islands, Philippines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  At the aptly named Hundred Islands National Park, we will initially disembark by Zodiac and transfer to local boats to do some island hopping, as well as swimming, snorkelling and sunbathing. The local outrigger boats will pass and stop at several of the descriptively named islands, including Marcos, Cathedral, Quezon, Bat, Cuenco, Children’s, Mayor’s and Governor’s Islands. &nbsp;Watch for dolphins, dugong and sea turtles that have been recorded in this national park and marine reserve. </p>\n<p>  Another option for you is to visit the Coral Garden on the other side of Quezon (one of only three developed islands in the area) for some snorkelling.</p>\n<p>  In the afternoon, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will continue south along the coast of Luzon and while aboard, be sure to attend the Videographer’s presentation of our voyage documentary.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 — Manila, Philippines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nFollowing breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 – Manila, Philippines</strong><br />\n  Embark the <em>Silver Discoverer</em> for this exciting Silversea Expedition across the Philippines and into the Philippine Sea. This afternoon, you will attend a safety briefing before leaving Manila. <br />\n  Later, important members of the crew will be introduced, as well as your Expedition Team. We invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and in the evening enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.&nbsp;<br />\n  At dinnertime <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will head for the Mindoro Strait.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 – Apo Reef, Philippines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  A reef and three islands make up the Apo Reef Natural Park which is also a tentative UNESCO World Heritage Site. Apo Island is the largest island and harbours mangroves and beach vegetation on its 22 hectares. Apo Reef, the important and main geographical features of the park, lies to the east of Apo Island. Binangaan is a small rocky Iimestone island with relatively little vegetation and Cayos del Bajo a coralline rock formation with no vegetation. <br />\n  Snorkelers will enjoy the crystal blue waters and be looking for some of the 400 varieties of soft and hard corals registered, cushion stars, damsel fishes, butterfly fishes, angel fishes, parrot fishes, cardinal fishes, trigger fishes, and wrasses.<br />\n  For those who want to relax on a beach, a visit to Apo Island, which features a shallow lagoon surrounded by a verdant mangrove forest, will be of interest. Close to 50 species of birds have been recorded for the park and there are records of the rare Nicobar Pigeon for Apo Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 – San Fernando, Sibuyan, Philippines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  Your stay in San Fernando will present a unique opportunity to become immersed in the traditional ways of Sibuyan Island. <br />\n  At the time of our arrival ashore, the local community will be pulling in fishing nets and an Udyak (a celebration for the catch) will take place. We will be welcomed by the Sibuyan Mangyan Tagabukid indigenous community and will partake in a cleansing ritual with scented smoke.&nbsp; At the market the mayor will officially welcome us, before we will take Jeepneys to reach Taclobo Village to see and partake in a Paguma, or rice planting and harvesting. While we learn and plant, traditional folk singers will entertain us. After this hands-on and feet-in-mud activity we will continue in our Jeepneys to the Cantingas River and a ceremony to honour the unseen spirits. Afterwards the indigenous community members of Taclobo Village will show how they catch freshwater shrimps and will have a cooking demonstration involving the shrimp. You can swim in the Cantingas River, considered the cleanest body of water in the Philippines. <br />\n  After lunch aboard, we will head back ashore for a Pag-alad Festival, an annual commemoration of the transfer of the town of Azagra to San Fernando. We will see the 17th century Casa del Cuartel, declared an Important Cultural Property, watch street dancing and will taste some local cuisine.<br />\n  To close the day, each guest is given an ironwood or <em>tiga</em> (an extremely hard and endemic hardwood) seedling for planting.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 4 – Donsol and Ticao Island, Philippines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  During the morning we will visit the island of Donsol whose bay is home to&nbsp;schools&nbsp;of whale sharks and reputedly has the world’s largest concentration of these massive fish. During the month of May whale sharks can usually be seen by divers and non-divers, swimmers and non-swimmers. For the chance to swim with the whale sharks we will use official local boats.<br />\n  During lunch aboard, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will sail south to reach Ticao Island. Again we will use our Zodiacs for some island hopping, admiring limestone formations and the Catandayagan waterfalls, swimming and snorkelling in crystal clear water, or simply relaxing on white sand beaches.<br />\n  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 5 – San Luis, Capul Island, Philippines</strong><br />\n  If Donsol and Ticao were meant for relaxation, the visit to Capul today will be busy with participation in a local fiesta. Once ashore, we will be taken by motorcycle (today’s mode of transportation) to a coconut farm and we will be divided into task groups to prepare <em>puso</em> (rice cooked in young coconut leaves), chicken <em>tinola</em>, stuffed squid, grilled blue marlin and coconut-based desserts. If you are not culinary inclined, you can be part of the banquet table decoration team.<br />\n  While you wait for the food to be cooked, a coconut harvesting, husking, grating, drying, packing and transporting demonstration will take place. Then the food prepared will be displayed at the banquet tables and can be eaten in the traditional Filipino farm style.<br />\n  Guests will then be divided into groups to see three heritage sites on the island including a Spanish-built lighthouse overlooking the San Bernardino Strait, the 17th century fortress church of St. Ignatius de Loyola and the Banadero, a spring used by the Galleon Trade before heading out to Acapulco.<br />\n  During the afternoon, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will head from the Philippine Sea to the Visayan Sea. Our course will eventually go back into the Philippine Sea and the island of Bohol. On board lecturers will present talks or seminars, but you can also relax on the outer decks and watch the landscape and islands go by.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 6 – Bohol and Balicasag Island, Philippines </strong><br />\n  An early morning departure from Tagbilaran means a chance at the best light for photos of the Chocolate Hills found in Central Bohol. There are more than 1,200 of these conical karst hills and in the dry season the grass that covers the hills turns brown, and hence their name. At a viewing station you can choose to climb more than 200 steps for a panorama that is well worth the effort.<br />\n  To see some of the other unusual features of Bohol, we will partake in a cruise on the Loay River. On local boats watch the lush green landscape go by while being serenaded by local musicians and enjoying light snacks of local delicacies.<br />\n  A visit to a Tarsier Sanctuary will give us a chance to see one of the smallest primates, the endemic Philippine tarsier, and proceeding to Baclayon, we will see some of the oldest heritage houses and the oldest stone church on the island. While there, you might want to taste <em>broa</em>, a local delicacy -supposedly the BEST lady fingers in the world!<br />\n  Following lunch aboard and during the afternoon we will relax on Balicasag Island. This tiny island is located southwest of Tagbilaran and surrounded by a beautiful sandy beach. Fringed by a narrow reef shelf the island is well liked by snorkelers on the lookout for colourful schools of reef fish, turtles, wrasses, groupers, and barracuda.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Cagayan de Oro, Philippines</strong><br />\n  Coming ashore at Macabalan Port, we will have a welcome and cultural reception before transferring to the Bulua pottery and the Vjandep Bakeshop to view pastel baking and hopefully trythis famous Camiguin delicacy. Transferring to Chali Beach we will have a cooking demonstration of the typical Mindanao and Visayas “Sinuglaw.” This refers to grilling food that has been soaked in vinegar. Lunch ashore will include corn cake and local desserts.<br />\n  In the afternoon there will be more food tasting and a visit to the Museo de Oro at the Xavier University. This museum highlights findings of a nearby excavation, folkloric artefacts and old photographs. The San Agustin Cathedral will be the last stop before returning to the port and <em>Silver Discoverer.</em><br />\n  If the food options, aboard and ashore, are overwhelming, you may choose instead to try white water rafting in lower Mambuyan. As it is the only white water rafting destination in the country, Cagayan de Oro is known as the \"White Water Rafting Capital of the Philippines.\"<br />\n  &nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 8 — Mambajao, Camiguin Island, Philippines</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor off Camiguin’s east side and we will go ashore in Benoni. After a welcome ceremony, venture into the foothills of Mt. Hibok-Hibok, an active volcano. Stop at the ruins of the Moro Watchtower and see the processing and preparation of local delicacies. Continuing on the morning tour we will reach a fishing village and witness how the locals catch the fish and process dried squid. We will visit the town plaza of Sagay before returning to the port and lunch aboard <em>Silver Discoverer.</em><br />\n  The afternoon is planned to be spent at the Mantigue Island Sanctuary. The island covers a total of 4 hectares and is located 3 kilometres from Camiguin’s shore. This island offers glowing white powdery sand beaches and a small shade-giving forest. A huge diversity of macro creatures, clown fish and turtles is a must-see for our snorkelers. <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 9 — Limasawa Island, Philippines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  Limasawa will offer not only a welcome by local performers, the community and officials, but will lead you back in time to Magellan’s attempt to circumnavigate the world. This is where the first Christian Mass was held in the Philippines and you will walk to the National Shrine of the First Mass. Later a replica of a Pintado longhouse will be visited, where you can see young men and women in Pintados costumes and will enjoy a performance of a dance-drama relating to the famous ruler Rajah Kulambo. The word “pintados” (painted) goes back to Magellan’s companion Pigafetta and refers to the local custom of tattooing – here you can also get a henna tattoo.<br />\n  At mid-morning an Anibong Festival will be prepared. This was done to present the young women before they were taken as brides. Local entertainers will liven up the atmosphere while guests will be split into groups and dressed in traditional costumes to partake in the festival and will learn to prepare blue crabs, lobster Thermidor local style, breadfruit, grilled white marlin, assorted deep-fried fowls, squid stew and assorted seaweed. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Sohoton Bay, Philippines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  Sohoton Bay has many special sites, but the Sohoton Cove National Park just slightly to the east on Bucas Grande’s southwestern side is enchanting. The half-submerged entrance is the only way in and out and can only be used at low tide. It is almost impossible to find if you come at the wrong time of the day. Sohoton Cove National Park is filled with gorgeous, muffin-shaped, forest-covered islets. Most of them are untouched by human hands and the natural arrangement acts like a gigantic, natural maze. The blue lagoon is also home to several caves and caverns and a fantastic variety of flora and fauna. <br />\n  Magkukuob cavern is another cave in one of the seven islets inside Sohoton Cove. Its walls have natural colours from yellow to aqua to turquoise which makes it surreal. Climbing an enthralling passage whose adjoining walls offers a stunning display of mineral-encrusted stalactites and stalagmites you will reach a 5-meter jump off point to the clear, blue sea right below your feet. Another attraction in Sohoton Cove is the jellyfish sanctuary at Tojoman Lagoon where one can swim with thousands of non-stinging spotted jellyfishes only found between March and June.<br />\n  This last day in Sohoton Bay and Sohoton Cove will be an remarkable end to our exploration of the “Emerald Islands” of the Philippines and forges a connection to Palau’s famous Rock Islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 11-12 — At Sea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  While <em>Silver Discoverer</em> sails in a south-easterly direction experience the exhilaration of being at sea and out of sight of land. It is awe inspiring to look out in all directions and find the simple beauty of undulating ocean waves, wispy clouds and foaming sea spray. Members of the expedition team are ever-vigilant during sea days watching for seabirds, marine mammals, schools of feeding fish, and any other unexpected wildlife interactions to share with our guests on the outer decks at a moment’s notice. <br />\n  Take advantage of the fresh air and boundless vistas out on deck, or perhaps join the Executive Chef for a culinary demonstration, or the bar team for a wine tasting. If you would like to have a Spa treatment 
or do some work-out in the Gym, these two days might be just perfect.<br />\n  In the afternoon of our last day at sea, do not forget to attend the Videographer’s presentation of our voyage documentary.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 – Koror, Palau&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will come alongside in Malakal Harbour before breakfast. Malakal Island is connected to Koror via two bridges. If you prefer a self-exploration of Koror, you can head into town and visit the National Museum of Palau or the private Etpison Museum with its outstanding exhibition on “traditional money.” To have a look at Palau’s underwater creatures you could visit the Aquarium. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  If you are a snorkeler or like special geological features, take the inclusive excursion and head out to see the famous “Rock Islands” — a must, if you have not been to Palau before. This UNESCO World Heritage Site has 445 uninhabited limestone islands of volcanic origin. The beauty of these islands is heightened by a complex reef system featuring over 385 coral species. The area sustains a diversity of plants, birds and marine life including dugong and at least thirteen shark species. The world’s highest concentration of marine lakes (isolated bodies of seawater separated from the ocean by land barriers) is also found here. Although most of them can only be accessed by scientists, the so-called Jellyfish Lake, used to be a snorkel highlight to swim among thousands of harmless jellyfish. Unfortunately, in recent times jellyfish numbers have declined and authorities have closed access to the lake to protect its integrity. <br />\n  Another option would be to go on an excursion to see some of the cultural and archaeological points of interest on Babeldaob, Palau’s largest island. These include man-made terraces and the famous <em>bai</em> (men’s meeting houses). Whatever you choose to do in Palau, it will be busy and fascinating day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 — Koror, Palau&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Koror, Palau</strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Discoverer</em> for this stunning Silversea Expedition entitled, “Marvels of Melanesia.” This afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and attend a safety briefing. Tonight we invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — Koror, Palau</strong><br />\nThis morning you can go into town for some self-exploration and visit the National Museum of Palau or the private Etpison Museum with its outstanding exhibition on “traditional money,” or have a look at Palau’s underwater creatures in the Aquarium.</p>\n<p>Conversely, Silversea Expeditions offers guests the opportunity to join an excursion to see the famous “Rock Islands.” This UNESCO World heritage Site is a must-see if you have not been to Palau before. We will go in local speed boats to see the labyrinth of channels and islands and to snorkel in Palauan waters.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will steam out of Koror’s inner harbor. Be out on deck to see Babeldaob Island with its mangrove coast and terraced hills offset by countless hues of lagoon blues and greens. &nbsp;The ship will cruise through these shallows to exit the lagoon and head into open waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 — At Sea</strong><br />\nRelax aboard <em>Silver Discoverer</em> after your time ashore in Palau. A Zodiac briefing will likely start our program, followed by a snorkel briefing and snorkel equipment, should you need some, will be distributed. Let our team of lecturers and naturalists prepare you for the different aspects of Papua New Guinea. Join them in the Explorer Lounge for presentations on local and European history of the area, and find out what makes New Guinea so special.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — At Sea</strong><br />\nA leisurely day at sea invites you to take advantage of the luxurious amenities aboard <em>Silver Discoverer</em>. Help our bird-watchers spot some of the seabirds found far away from their nesting grounds, or enjoy a lecture about the natural history of northern Papua New Guinea. An interesting book can be good company, too. Alternatively, just relax in the comfort of your suite and watch a movie on the in-suite interactive television.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Vanimo, Papua New Guinea</strong><br />\nThis morning we arrive in Papua New Guinea. After completing the immigration formalities we will set out to explore one of Papua New Guinea’s most remote regions. The Sandaun Province is relatively undeveloped, with lovely beaches, crystal clear lagoons and picturesque villages. </p>\n<p>After a short welcome ceremony, we will set off in local minivans to explore further afield. Since Vanimo does not receive many visitors, the main attraction in many places will actually be our visit. Don’t forget your bathing suit as we will have the opportunity to cool down at one of the beautiful beach locations outside of town.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Ali Island, Papua New Guinea</strong><br />\nAli Island is one of the four islands located close to Aitape, off the northern coast of Papua New Guinea. The eastern shore of Ali Island has a beautiful white sandy beach and offers swimming and snorkelling. The five villages on the island are all set up in string and well-maintained trails lead to the school and Catholic church closer to the northern end of the island. Guest will be welcomed with songs and dances and a village walk will take you past the clean local homes, their gardens and wells to the Catholic church with its interesting paintings regarding the <em>via crucis</em>. Chat with the islanders, relax on the beach, or take one of the local canoes to exercise your paddling skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Kopar Village, Sepik River, Papua New Guinea</strong><br />\n  The lower East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea has lagoons, mangrove swamps and sandbanks between the Sepik to the south and the Bismarck Sea to the north. This morning we will be in front of the Sepik River where, depending on the tides, we will either navigate upriver for a scenic Zodiac tour that will include a stop at Kopar or will be able to anchor in the Sepik, close to this small village inhabited by no more than 200 people. Our arrival here will also be heralded with a welcoming performance of song and dance.<br />\n  At Kopar locals from different villages will have gathered to show and sell their artefacts. The masks, baskets, bone carvings, drums, paddles will all be different from the artefacts and souvenirs you will see at other stops and islands of our voyage.<br />\n  For the keen birders, a Zodiac cruise will offer sights of flood plain birds, parrots and the odd kite.<br />\nDuring the night, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will pass by active volcanoes and we will be on the lookout for the hot lava of volcanic activity set against the night sky.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Alim Island, Papua New Guinea</strong><br />\nAlim Island is one of a small group of uninhabited islands south of Manus. This triangular-shaped island with long sandy beaches, coconut palm trees and coral reef offers a relaxing day in the Bismarck Archipelago. We will make use of the beaches and snorkel either from the beach or from anchored Zodiacs to see the multi-coloured fish and coral. Sea turtles lay their eggs on the islands and with luck we might even see some of these ancient mariners. </p>\n<p>In the afternoon <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will head south for our next set of adventures on the ‘mainland.’</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Madang, Papua New Guinea</strong><br />\n  Madang has one of the South Pacific’s most beautiful harbors, with a backdrop of steep mountains<br />\n  and lush tropical vegetation. The town of Madang was the center of heavy fighting during World War II<br />\n  and there are 34 sunken ships at Hansa Bay. The small town began its “modern life” as a result of the lucrative copra (coconut) trade. The wide avenues go back to the German administration of the late 19th century, and there is even a small European cemetery next to the local market.<br />\nDuring today’s tour, we will see the Coastwatcher’s Memorial Lighthouse, which was dedicated in 1959 to the Allied Forces and local civilians who served against the Japanese in WWII. We will also visit Bilbil Village, famous for its pottery. Keep an eye out for the flying foxes that hang from trees during the day as there are many of them in town.</p>\n<p>The many islands and channels north of Madang’s centre invite to be explored by Zodiac. Conditions permitting, we will set out in the afternoon for a Zodiac cruise passing local homes and mangroves, weaving our way through the channels and islands, for a taste of local life along the shoreline.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Garove, Papua New Guinea</strong><br />\n  Garove is part of the Witu Islands and once had a 5-kilometer-wide caldera. The island was, and in fact still is, used to produce copra and most of the villages are located around the exterior of the volcano. Around lunchtime we hope to enter the now flooded caldera through its narrow entrance. <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\nSteep cliffs explain why there is only one settled area on the inside. Going ashore near a little promontory we will be greeted by singing and will be lead to the open ground in front of the school and church for some traditional dances. Hikers might want to reach the higher levels of the village. </p>\n<p>If you choose to swim at the small beach close to the landing site, you may well find yourself outnumbered by local kids enjoying the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Tsoi Island, Papua New Guinea</strong><br />\nTsoi Island is a small island west of New Hannover and east of New Ireland. White sandy beaches, a turquoise lagoon, palm trees and lush vegetation make this a small South Pacific paradise. We will go ashore to see the local life and will look for the perfect spot for snorkelling and swimming. Relax under the swaying palm trees and enjoy a refreshing coconut. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Rabaul, Papua New Guinea</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Discoverer</em> has journeyed along the coast of New Ireland to reach the northern tip of New Britain – Papua New Guinea’s largest island – to eventually come to Rabaul from the south.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\nIf the conditions are right, you will be able to see rising fumes of the volcano Tavurvur while we enter Blanche Bay and head into Simpson Harbour. Rabaul, the former provincial capital, has quite a remarkable location as the town is located inside the flooded caldera of a giant volcano. Several sub-vents are still quite active today! Certainly, this is an approach, island, bay and harbor not to be missed. Join the expedition team on the outer decks as <em>Silver Discoverer</em> approaches Rabaul and take in the scenery, with volcanoes left and right.</p>\n<p>The town has suffered greatly from the last major eruption of 1994 when some 80% of the houses collapsed due to the ash raining down onto their roofs. On our tour we will have a look at Rabaul and the Volcano Observatory, which monitors 14 active and 23 dormant volcanoes in Papua New Guinea. We will also see some of the Japanese tunnels and barges used during WWII and will visit Kokopo with its market and museum. Panoramic views are on hand of Blanche Bay and the Duke of York Islands across Kokopo’s golf course, the former estate of Emma Forsyth, better known as “Queen Emma.”</p>\n<p>In the evening, we will witness a nocturnal dance performance by the Baining, one of Melanesia’s exceptional traditional groups and their elaborate “costumes.” When the men with their giant tapa masks jump through the fire, they seem to come from another world all together.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 — Cruising the Solomon Sea</strong><br />\n  While <em>Silver Discoverer</em> crosses the Solomon Sea, members of our Expedition Team will prepare you for the Gizo Area and the Solomon Islands. Talks may well focus on the special underwater riches that Njari holds for us.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 — Njari Island, Solomon Islands</strong><br />\n  Today, we visit one of the smallest of the islands of the Solomons. As soon as the local authorities have cleared us into the country, we will offer water sport activities in front of uninhabited Njari. The island’s reef teems with brilliantly coral species and in terms of fish the waters hold one of the highest species counts ever recorded in one dive. This is an absolute highlight for snorkelling!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 15 — Pavuvu Island, Solomon Islands</strong><br />\nThe Russel Islands, of which Pavuvu is largest, produce dried coconut meat, also known as copra. Coconut palm plantations carpet the island and small-scale operations are favored by the locals. </p>\n<p>Close to Guadalcanal, the Russel Islands were chosen by American Marines during World War II to prepare for battles further east, but little remains of their time here. In addition to workers in the copra plantations who come from different Solomon Islands, Pavuvu permits relocated settlers from Tikopia to find a new home on the island.&nbsp; Therefore local artistic expressions are both Melanesian and Polynesian. Enjoy cultural presentations and use the day to leisurely stroll through the area, or relax on the beach. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 16 — Honiara, Solomon Islands</strong><br />\nFollowing breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity. Expedition Team members scheduled for this voyage are subject to change or cancellation.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>360 DEGREES OF GIVING</strong> <br />\n  They say it’s better to give than to receive, luckily we have the opportunity to do both. The friendly villagers we visit throughout our expedition welcome us with such warm hearts, and we receive so much from them, that we want to make sure we’re giving right back.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of goodwill, we greatly encourage you to help us support the local communities we will be visiting. Gifts may consist of second-hand children’s clothing, school supplies (pencils, pens, and writing tablets), and medical supplies (Band-Aids, antiseptic wipes, and first aid items). Supplies received will be collected on board by the Expedition Team and evenly distributed throughout the villages as we visit.</p>\n<p><strong>GEAR UP</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not sure what to wear while onboard? <a style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http://www.shiptoshoretraveler.com/silversea\">Visit our shop and gear up</a>.

This afternoon, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and attend a safety briefing. Tonight we invite you to familiarize yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day&nbsp;2 — Lumalihe Island, Marovo Lagoon, Solomon Islands</strong><strong> </strong><br />\nMarovo Lagoon is one of the world’s largest saltwater lagoons. Described as “one of the seven natural wonders of the world,” Marovo is home to a double barrier reef system, and is one of two sites in the Solomon’s currently under consideration for UNESCO World Heritage Site status. Though residents of Marovo Lagoon normally do not dance due to religious beliefs, we hope to hear some of their songs. The people here are also quite famous for their woodcarvings, and we hope to see (and perhaps purchase) some of the intricately carved and adorned artefacts.</p>\n<p>Snorkelling in the lagoon will reveal incredibly steep coral reef walls that are colonized by gorgonian fan forests, black coral gardens, giant clams, sea turtles, manta rays, eels, barracuda, octopus, morays, grey reef sharks, lionfish and shoals of pelagic fish. Meanwhile, bird-watchers can look for osprey, Brahminy Kite and kingfisher, in the trees on one of the many surrounding islands.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 — Vona Vona Lagoon, Solomon Islands</strong><br />\n  Kohingo and Vona Vona Islands lie on the western side of New Georgia. In between them is Vona Vona Lagoon, a veritable maze of coral reefs and little islets. This is an area that was quite feared in the 19th century, as villages left on raids against other islands and settlements. A tidally dependent visit to Skull Island may disclose the shrine of local warrior chiefs from the head hunting past of this area. A trip by Zodiac through the stunning Vona Vona Lagoon, or a ride to one of the nearby tidal rivers that run through lowland rainforest may be on offer. Twisting passages through the lagoon hold mangrove lined shores that are home to rare freshwater fish, exotic tropical birds and saltwater crocodiles. &nbsp;Local knowledge is highly prized for finding places to snorkel in the crystal clear waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Karamolun and Pavuvu Island, Solomon Islands</strong><br />\nThe Russel Islands, of which Pavuvu is largest, produce dried coconut meat, also known as copra. Coconut palm plantations carpet the island and small-scale operations are favored by the locals. </p>\n<p>Close to Guadalcanal, the Russel Islands were chosen by American Marines during World War II to prepare for battles further east, but little remains of their time here. In addition to workers in the copra plantations who come from different Solomon Islands, Pavuvu permits relocated settlers from Tikopia to find a new home on the island.&nbsp; Therefore local artistic expressions are both Melanesian and Polynesian. Enjoy cultural presentations and use the day to leisurely stroll through the area, relax on the beach, or snorkel in calm waters teeming with all kinds of fish, as well as turtles and perhaps even dolphin. \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Roderick Bay, Solomon Islands</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Your Expedition Leader will likely encourage you to be out on deck in the early morning as we approach the Sandfly Passage to reach Roderick Bay, on the western side of Nggela Sule in the Florida Islands. </p>\n<p>In the bay you will see that huge trees give shade to picture-perfect little beaches. Going ashore we will witness a folkloric presentation and in one shallow bay you will find the resting place of a ‘famous’ shipwreck. It’s fascinating to see how nature is slowly covering the ship’s surface with plants from shore and corals below the water line.</p>\n<p>The bay invites swimming and snorkelling around the ship’s hull where corals are teeming with tropical fish. The snorkelling might also reveal feather stars, colourful nudibranches, vase sponges, gorgonian fans, lionfish and octopus – all part of this truly remarkable marine environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Santa Ana, Solomon Islands</strong><br />\nToday <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will enter Port Mary, the bay in front of Ghupuna, Santa Ana’s main village. A short Zodiac ride will take you onto a beautiful white sand beach with huge shade-giving trees. Once ashore, you can’t help but notice the tidy village with its stilt houses built from local materials. After a welcome on the beach we will head to the sport grounds where we will be entertained by traditional songs and dances performed by members of the three different villages on Santa Ana. No doubt islanders will set up stands with souvenirs on offer ranging from traditional shell money to fishing floats, and carvings based on local stories and legends. </p>\n<p>In the afternoon <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will continue eastward. Let our lecturers enhance your understanding of the region or introduce you to our next destination. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Utupua Island, Solomon Islands</strong><br />\nThis morning <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will enter the deep bay on Utupua’s western side. Nembao, one of the main villages on the island, will be our host this day. After a short Zodiac ride we will land on the sandy beach next to the village’s centre. Here expect a welcome and attend a presentation of traditional dances and songs. </p>\n<p>You may choose to observe how these Solomon Islanders live by walking along the beach to have a look at the houses, fishing canoes and small plantations.&nbsp; If tides and time permit, it may be an option to take the Zodiacs out to explore the mangrove-lined shores deeper in the bay on the lookout for birdlife, schools of fish, young sharks and mudskippers.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu</strong><br />\nDuring the morning, <em>Silver Discoverer </em>will approach Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu’s largest island. The European name goes back to the early 17th century when Pedro de Quiroz believed he had reached the famous “Tierra Australis Incognita,” the unknown southern land, which he called “La Austrialia del Espiritu Santo.”</p>\n<p>Once we officially clear into Vanuatu, you will have a chance to enjoy one of the finest beaches of her many islands. You can relax under stately <em>Barringtonia</em> trees draped in Alexandrian laurel that offer cool shade, or swim and snorkel in the crystal-clear water. Perhaps you will opt to visit the remnants of the WWII American Base field hospital and meet the locals who can introduce you to some of their customs and culture, while at the same time invoking their amazing understanding of the local environment and history. It may also be possible to take a Zodiac cruise from the beach, up the river through dense jungle, to swim in one of the famed blue holes of Espiritu Santo.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, enjoy an exceptional performance by the Banks Island women, who create ‘water music’ with their hands in the sea.&nbsp; This is surely one of the most unusual musical groups of Vanuatu.&nbsp; Later, find yourself a comfy spot to watch the sunset from an idyllic setting on the beach.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Pentecost and Ambrym, Vanuatu</strong><br />\nMorning will find the <em>Silver Discoverer</em> in front of Pentecost Island. Zodiacs will shuttle the ship’s company ashore to witness one of the most unusual socio-religious events in Vanuatu and in indeed in all of the South Pacific. The daring of the young men of Pentecost is impressive as they dive headfirst, connected by lengths of natural vine, from a specially constructed 30-meter tower onto the bare earth at its base. This ceremony can only take place from April to June when the vines have just the right moisture content to stretch and absorb the impact of their monumental dive. </p>\n<p>Traditionally, the ceremony welcomes the yam harvest. It is a celebration for the whole village and many people turn out in traditional costume to dance and chant, whipping the atmosphere into an excited frenzy of dance, activity and noise. After the event, we will be invited to tour the local village and meet the children who may sing for us and show us around their school and village. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>During lunch, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> sails south to Ambrym, another very special and highly active volcanic island. Its dark sand beaches speak of ancient lava flows.</p>\n<p>Ambrym is known as the island of magic, and we will go ashore near Ranon to visit the local community and see the famed ‘Rom’ dance. We are fortunate to experience this ceremony as the Rom dance is normally only undertaken during significant occasions when the participants prepare their masks and costumes in secrecy. In addition to the mesmerizing Rom dance, we will be entertained by a local string band and hope to see some of Vanuatu’s sand drawings. The drawings may appear simply as aesthetically pleasing drawings, but UNESCO recognizes them as a local system of writing, and consequently inscribed them on the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Port Resolution, Tanna, Vanuatu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </strong><br />\nDuring the morning, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will continue to sail south, to reach Port Resolution which was named after Captain Cook’s famous ship. Tanna is largely an agricultural economy, but was decimated in 2015 by Cyclone Pam. The local community welcomes visitors but is still very much connected to their tradition and custom.</p>\n<p>Going ashore onto the volcanically created black sand beach, we will be welcomed by the inhabitants of a nearby village. Singers from the ‘John Frum Cargo Cult’ will entertain us as local men and women present traditional dances. Following the performance, the people may offer to take you on a tour of their village and demonstrate daily living skills in a subsistence economy. </p>\n<p>As evening approaches, we will climb into 4WD vehicles to reach an area close to the summit of Mount Yasur. This is the most accessible explosive volcano in the world. Locals believe their spirit god dwells in the mountain, and so it is a sacred place to the local tribes. Be amazed by the power beneath your feet and stand in awe of the fireworks display at sunset. Local guides will instruct you on safe viewing areas depending on the wind and levels of activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Port Vila, Vanuatu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> <br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer.</em><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

The friendly villagers we visit throughout our expedition welcome us with such warm hearts, and we receive so much from them, that we want to make sure we’re giving right back.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of goodwill, we greatly encourage you to help us support the local communities we will be visiting. Gifts may consist of second-hand children’s clothing, school supplies (pencils, pens, and writing tablets), and medical supplies (Band-Aids, antiseptic wipes, and first aid items).

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Port Vila, Vanuatu</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Embark the&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer</em>&nbsp;for this stunning Silversea Expedition – Pearls of the Coral Sea. This afternoon, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and attend a safety briefing. Tonight we invite you to familiarize yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — Pentecost and Ambrym, Vanuatu</strong><br />\n  In the early morning <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be in front of Pentecost Island. We will go ashore via Zodiac to witness one of the most unusual socio-religious events in Vanuatu and the South Pacific. You will be astounded by the daring of the young men of Pentecost as they dive head first from a specially constructed 30 metre tower onto the bare earth at the base. This ceremony takes place only during the months of April to June when the vines to which the men have tied themselves have the right moisture content to be flexible enough to take the impact of the fall. </p>\n<p>  This ceremony welcomes in the yam harvest and is a celebration for the whole village which turns out in traditional costume to dance and chant, whipping the atmosphere into an excited frenzy of dance, activity and noise. Depending on the age and daring of the participants the height from which they jump will increase and it really is a leap of faith –which ends with the head of the jumper touching the softened ground.</p>\n<p>  After the dance we can tour the local village and meet the children who may sing for us and show us around their school and village.&nbsp; </p>\n<p>  During lunch <em>Silver Discoverer</em> sails south to Ambrym, another very special island. Ambrym is a volcanic and active (!) island with dark beaches. </p>\n<p>  Ambrym is known as the island of magic and of the 113 local language of Vanuatu 5 alone are spoken on Ambrym –apart from Bislama, one of the three official languages of the country. </p>\n<p>  We will go ashore near Ranon to have a look at the local community and see the very unique Rom dance. Normally these dances are only shown during grade-taking ceremonies or men’s secret society meetings and on those occasions the participants actually prepare their masks and costumes in secrecy.</p>\n<p>  Apart from the mesmerizing Rom dance we will be entertained by one of the local string bands and hope to see some of Vanuatu’s sand drawings. Although some might simply see them as aesthetically pleasing drawings, UNESCO has recognised them as a local “writing” system and inscribed them on the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day&nbsp;3 — Makura Island, Vanuatu</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Makura in the Shepherds is not only a small island with steep slopes on the east and south side and sandy beaches on the north and northwestern shore, but it is actually the peak of a primeval volcano. The other existing ramparts of the volcanic rim are believed to be the neighbouring islands of Emae and Mataso. Roughly 3,000 people call the Shepherds Islands home and Makura Island has a rather small population mainly living on the northwestern side, close to the beach. We hope to visit this village with its rugged volcanic backdrop and apart from a viewing a cultural presentation might hike towards the top of the island.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Aniwa and Port Resolution, Tanna, Vanuatu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  During the morning <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be in front of Aniwa Island, a small uplifted coral platform in the southernmost province of Vanuatu. A vivid coral reef has formed here in recent times and grows now where tongues of lava once overran the volcanic slopes and flowed into the ocean. As the corals, sponges and anemones overgrow the dark lava rock, schools of vivid reef fish cruise above. Apart from snorkelling and swimming over this young reef, we might also get to visit the village ashore –although this is very much tide-dependent.<br />\nDuring lunch <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will continue to sail south to reach Tanna and Port Resolution –named after Captain Cook’s famous ship. Tanna’s local community welcomes visitors but is still very much connected to their tradition and custom.</p>\n<p>  Going ashore onto the black sandy beach –an indication of the volcanic activity of the island- we will be welcomed on the beach by the inhabitants of the nearby village. There will be an activity by the John Frum Cargo Cult singers. The men and women will present some traditional dances and will later take you on a tour of their village and demonstrate daily living skills in a subsistence economy. </p>\n<p>  At 4pm we will embark 4WD vehicles to reach an area close to the summit of Mount Yasur -the most accessible explosive volcano in the world. Locals believe their spirit god dwells in there so it is a sacred place to the local tribes. Be amazed by the power beneath your feet and stand in awe of the fireworks display at sunset. Local guides will instruct you on safe viewing areas depending on the wind and levels of activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Aneghowhat, Aneityum Island, and Mystery Island, Vanuatu</strong><br />\n  Aneityum is a little tropical island paradise and is Vanuatu's southernmost inhabited island. The interior is mountainous and covered with forest. Along the coast, pine plantations contrast with coconut palms, white sand beaches and coral reefs. Aneghowhat is the main settlement on its southwestern side \nAneityum is a good island for walking with a slightly cooler climate. After a visit to Aneityum we will transfer to Inyeug Island, better known as Mystery Island. This small island southwest of Aneityum holds the airstrip –used only twice a week- but otherwise is all beaches and reefs. We want to make the most of the afternoon relaxing on the beach or swimming and snorkelling in the tranquil waters looking for the many tropical fishes hiding between the corals.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Noumea, New Caledonia</strong><br />\n  Noumea started as a penal colony but since the country is very rich in resources, especially Nickel and other minerals, and Noumea has a large natural harbour, the city has attracted many settlers and today prides itself to have almost two thirds of the country’s population living in Greater Noumea.</p>\n<p>  While New Caledonia has a large percentage of the Kanak –the indigenous inhabitants- living in tribal areas across the country, Noumea is predominantly European (French) influenced.<br />\n  The city’s centre and Place de Cocotiers, the main park, are located close to the harbour and several churches date back to the late 19th century and the creation of Noumea’s business district through landfills into the lagoon. </p>\n<p>  Apart from many marinas and several long beaches to the south, with an excellent aquarium at Anse Vata, Noumea has an outstanding collection of Kanak and South Pacific objects at the Museum of New Caledonia. An architectural highlight is the Tjibaou Cultural Centre. The structure resembles sails or the roofs of Kanak houses hidden behind mangroves and is one of the most stunning man-made views the Pacific has to offer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Île des Pins, New Caledonia</strong><br />\nÎle des Pins most prominent features are the New Caledonia pines –after which the island was named when seen by Captain Cook. <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor in front of Kuto Bay and we will take our Zodiacs to land at Kuto’s little pier. Vao is the main settlement close to Kuto and Kanumera and has interesting local carvings next to a Catholic monument and the village’s <em>chefferie</em>, the residence of the main chief.</p>\n<p>  The beaches at Kuto and close-by Kanumera are some of the finest beaches in the South Pacific and while Kuto is for swimming, Kanumera and the giant rock in its bay are for snorkelling. At low tide a sandbar extends to the rock –but since the local Kanak consider it sacred, it is forbidden to climb onto it. For those who still would like to do a bit of climbing, a hike to Pic Nga, at 262 metres the island’s highest elevation, can be arranged. </p>\n<p>  The island was used in the 19th century as a prison for political exiles from France and remains can still be seen at Kuto, near the landing site and at nearby Ouro. <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Days 8-9 — Days at Sea, crossing the Coral Sea</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n<em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be crossing the Coral Sea for the following two days. This will give you time to relax, to make use of the Gym and Spa, to enjoy views of the open ocean from the outer decks and meet with fellow travellers for a drink in the Explorer Lounge or next to the Pool Bar.</p>\n<p>  On the other hand, our team of lecturers would like to entertain you with information and stories about the area we are travelling through and the various highlights Australia’s east coast has in store for us. Attend a lecture or seminar and sample the culinary specialties prepared by our Executive Chef and his galley team. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Bundaberg, Australia</strong><br />\nToday <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will enter Australia. Bundaberg is the provincial hub of a vibrant, unique region, and is centred on the picturesque Burnett River at the southern tip of the Great Barrier Reef. The area around Bundaberg was used for logging and milling in the mid-19th century, but eventually sugarcane was planted and raw sugar still is one of the main export articles. One of the by-products has made Bundaberg quite famous: the rum made from molasses. Since the rum and distillery are not only famous but important to Bundaberg, we would like to offer a Rum Distillery Experience. Explore the museum housed within one of the retired bond stores, where you’ll move through a series of converted 75,000 litre oak vats which have matured hundreds of thousands of litres of Bundaberg Rum. You will also see the world’s largest collection of Bundaberg Rum bottles since the very first bottle was produced in 1888. This is a fully immersive rum experience, where you will get the same sense of scale and awe that the distillery team gets to experience every day. </p>\n<p>  Bundaberg has the most significant mainland turtle-nesting beach at Mon repos, and can count many heritage-listed buildings. Other interesting features of Bundaberg are the Hinkler Hall of Aviation, honouring a local aviator, and the Bundaberg Botanical Gardens –apart from several national parks in the region. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Fraser Island, Australia</strong><br />\n  Discover the beauty of World Heritage Listed Fraser Island aboard a purpose built, air-conditioned 4WD coach. Learn about the natural and cultural history of Fraser Island, at 1840 square kilometres the largest sand island in the world. You will visit and swim the crystal clear waters of the islands most famous and most spectacular lake, Lake McKenzie. At the historic central station in the heart of the island you can walk along the banks of the Wanggoolba Creek and immerse yourself in the peacefulness of the rainforest. <br />\nAnother way to discover some of Fraser Island's native birdlife and marine life is to join an experienced ranger on a guided canoe paddle in the waters of the Great Sandy Strait. Canoes are suitable for either 2 or 3 guests. Paddle for one hour just offshore in the beautiful coastal waters to try and spot the fish, rays and birds. Keep a sharp lookout, as you may even get a chance viewing of a turtle, dolphin or dugong that also call the waters of Fraser Island home.</p>\n<p>  The Butchulla people are the traditional owners of K'gari (Fraser Island).&nbsp;They lived in harmony with the seasons, the land and sea whilst maintaining a perfect balance between spiritual, social and family connections. Today the Butchulla people continue to walk the cultural pathway of their ancestors. You can discover how the Butchulla people survived and thrived on the island during an interesting and informative walking tour. Learn which bush foods are in season and how to use snake vine for a headache and the tea tree for a cold.&nbsp; You will uncover all sorts of native bush tucker in the natural environment and discover how to heal yourself in the bush on this guided stroll.</p>\n<p>  Despite the island being a sand island, it has over 100 lakes and the landscape changes constantly as dunes are being moved across the island by the wind. Although the speed of 1 to 2 metres a year seems to be slow, this certainly changes the island’s appearance. With over 350 bird species recorded, Fraser Island is part of an Important Bird Area and on the Australian National Heritage list.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Great Keppel Island, Australia</strong><br />\n  Great Keppel Island is slightly north of the Tropic of Capricorn and enjoys an ideal sub-tropical climate. Seen and named by Captain Cook in 1770, the island with its close to 1500 hectares is a sanctuary to extensive native flora and fauna. Seventeen white sand beaches ring the island, inviting swimming and snorkelling. Dolphins can be seen close to the main beaches, while humpback whales visits to Keppel Bay have increased in the last couple of years.<br />\nIsland bush walking affords chances to see brushtail possums, blue-tongued lizards and goannas, while bird-watchers will be looking for White-breasted Sea Eagles, Brahminy Kites, and Ospreys, Pied Oystercatchers, Beach Stone Curlews, as well as Rainbow Bee-eaters, Peaceful Doves, Varied Honeyeaters, friarbirds and kookaburras.</p>\n<p><em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be anchored in front of Great Keppel Island until late in the evening, permitting the use of the island’s crystal clear waters and the island itself for a full day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 13 — Wistari Reef, Australia</strong><br />\nNext to Heron Island, Wistari Reef is a special place: a natural coral reef some 60 kms off the coast of Queensland on the Great Barrier Reef. This is one of the best places to experience the underwater wonder of the world. The reef, with a myriad of colourful coral and reef fish, is at your fingertips. Although the breeding season is from October to March, neighbouring Heron Island has a resident population of around 4,000 turtles. Since they live around Wistari Reef and Heron Reef all year, one can expect to see turtles in the water anytime. Throughout most of the year Heron Island is a breeding and nesting sanctuary for a huge variety of birds. The biggest populations are the Black Noddies, Wedge-tailed Shearwaters and Eastern Reef Egrets. In certain months, up to 100,000 birds flock to the island. Other birds found breeding and living on the island are Black-faced Cuckoo-Shrikes, Buff-banded Rails, Capricorn Silvereyes, Sacred Kingfishers, Silver Gulls and White-bellied Sea Eagles. The University of Queensland has a world class marine research facility on the island, not only researching and monitoring but also teaching.</p>\n<p>We will make the most of bird-watching, swimming, and snorkelling. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 — Hardy Reef, Australia</strong><br />\n  Today <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will visit Hardy Reef –part of the Great Barrier Reef, off the Whitsundays coast of Australia. Hardy Reef is one of the many thousand small reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef. Its coral wall is home to an ecosystem of magnificent corals and marine life. Hundreds of fish species at Hardy will surprise and delight. The reef has been chosen to place pontoons so that visitors have specific protected areas where they can swim and snorkel and marvel at the many underwater wonders, amongst them the giant gropers. There are many other reef options in the&nbsp;area and we will choose our swimming and snorkelling spots based on sea conditions. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 15 — Townsville, Australia</strong><br />\n  This morning <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will go alongside in Townsville. <br />\n  Enjoy en encounter with locals, hear about the regions history and discover first hand unique insights into what makes Townsville in North Queensland such a special place to live. You will be transferred to Mrs. Smith’s Parlour, a historic venue is only opened for special occasions.&nbsp; Here you will be introduced to a group of passionate locals and you will be enjoying a morning tea created with local produce followed by a unique look at Townsville’s Central Business District area.</p>\n<p>  A somewhat different option is to meet Prof Kirsten Heimann, director of the North Queensland Algal Identification/Culturing Facility at James Cook University (JCU). She leads a microalgal research team focusing on developing microalgae for carbon dioxide and waste water remediation whilst generating valuable co-products.&nbsp;Prof Heimann also leads the methane remediation from underground coal mines project. Having published extensively in high ranking journals including ‘Nature’, her research has won many awards, including the NQ Corporate Business Women Award. This tour offers a unique opportunity to meet Prof Heimann and learn more about her pioneering microalgal research during an informative and engaging 2hr private presentation.</p>\n<p>  If you would like to see the Cape Cleveland Lighthouse you will cross Cleveland Bay by local boat, taking in the views of Townsville along the way. On arrival to Cape Cleveland you will be taken ashore by barge. Then you can walk up to the lighthouse and enjoy historical displays with regional lighthouse guides. Cape Cleveland Lighthouse was the first lighthouse to be built in Townsville in 1879 and is one of the region’s most sought after destinations. Spend your time taking in the natural beauty that Cape Cleveland has to offer. The isolation and beauty of this part of North Queensland is striking.</p>\n<p>  For those bent on independent exploration and keen on the Bounty history, the Museum of Tropical Queensland has an exhibition about HMS Pandora, Captain Edward Edwards’ ship sent to find the Bounty mutineers and eventually wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef.<br />\n  During the afternoon the onboard Videographer will present the final version of our Voyage-DVD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 16 — Cairns, Australia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> <br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer.</em><br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n<em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Cairns, Australia</strong> <br />\n  Embark the&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer</em>&nbsp;for this stunning Silversea Expedition – Mysteries of New Guinea. This afternoon, you will meet your Expedition Team and attend a safety briefing. Tonight we invite you to meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day&nbsp;2 — At Sea</strong> <br />\nWhile <em>Silver Discoverer</em> sails across the Coral Sea, get acquainted with the amenities on your home away from home for the next 17 days. Enjoy a leisurely breakfast and perhaps attend a workshop or lecture that will prepare you for the experiences of Papua New Guinea.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 — Alotau, Papua New Guinea</strong> <br />\nAlotau is the provincial capital of the Milne Bay Province and our port of entry into Papua New Guinea. The town and surrounding area has been an important staging ground during World War II and we will see remains and memorials dating back or referring to the war. On our tour of the town we will reach viewpoints of the bay and get to see the markets, which are frequented not only by locals, but also by islanders selling their products or looking for produce to take back into Milne Bay. Alotau is an important port facility for the islands and attracts many vendors of handicrafts from different islands. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Kafure, Papua New Guinea</strong> <br />\nKafure, located on the south-eastern peninsula of Cape Nelson in Oro Province, is situated next to a tropical fjord (the work of ancient volcanic activities) and is fringed by uncharted coral reefs. We will take our Zodiacs ashore at a small village to be welcomed with songs and dances. Later, climb into a local canoe to explore the smooth waters of the Kwapurina Fjord. With villagers as our oarsmen, we will be guided under canopies of ancient mangrove forests acting as home to a wide range of colorful birds and butterflies. Continuing on our journey, we return to the entrance of the fjord and the small settlement where villagers will demonstrate the making of tapa cloth and offer interesting souvenirs. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Tuam, Papua New Guinea</strong> <br />\nBanana-shaped Tuam is an uplifted coral atoll covered in palm trees. The only village is located on the lower eastern side of the island. Highly exposed to the trade winds, the islanders have set up protective walls made out of palm-branches giving the village the look of a fortified castle from a distance. A trail marked by white sand leads from the landing site to the settlement area of neatly organized wooden huts and houses with pandanus-thatched roofs. In the village, several dance groups will wait for us at different locations and will perform their special songs and dances.</p>\n<p>A walk in the forest permits you to see the different gardens set up in the “higher” regions of the island. The island has a spectacular reef and snorkelling next to the drop-off will reveal a myriad of reef fish.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Kopar Village, Papua New Guinea</strong> <br />\nDuring the afternoon, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will approach the Sepik River for a visit to Kopar, a small village of not more than 200 people at the river’s mouth. Depending on the tide and currents, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> might enter the Sepik River to anchor in front of this little village. The people of the Sepik are known for their artefacts and Kopar presents another opportunity for souvenir hunters. For the keen birders, a Zodiac cruise along the shore of the Sepik or into the small canals just upstream from Kopar village can be rewarded with sights of flood plain birds and parrots and the odd kite. During our visit we will present school supplies to the local community. Your donations will be very welcome. Please see below under the section entitled, “360 DEGREES OF GIVING.”</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Vanimo, Papua New Guinea</strong><br />\nVanimo will be our clearance port out of Papua New Guinea. Since visitors are quite rare in this part of the country, we will likely be the main attraction in town. After being greeted ashore we will drive to a local venue for traditional dancing and to see the handicrafts produced in Sandaun Province. Afterwards, we will drive to a local beach for a refreshing swim, or perhaps a walk along the beach to the next little village. To reach the village a stream might have to be crossed and at high tide this involves balancing across a tree trunk bridge.</p>\n<p>Everyone will return to our little expedition ship around sunset. During the evening hours <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be cleared out of the country to carry on along the north coast of New Guinea towards the Indonesian half of this large island. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Jayapura (Port Numbay), Indonesia</strong> <br />\n  At Jayapura – locally known as Port Numbay – we will receive our official clearance into Indonesia. &nbsp;A welcome at the ship will illustrate some of the traditional dances from West Papua. Inland from the town is Lake Sentani, famed for the distinctive art, traditional motifs, sago bowls and bark paintings of the people who live on and around the lake.<br />\nWe will take local buses to reach the shore of the lake and will then continue on native longboats to reach one of the islands. Here we will see a local dance presentation, walk around the island, perhaps climb up to the church for nice views of the lake, and will have the opportunity to see the famous lake artifacts including bark paintings and bride money.</p>\n<p>Return to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> shortly after noon for lunch aboard and to get underway for our next stop.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Pudaidori Island, Indonesia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> <br />\nDuring the morning, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will continue sailing westward to reach a small group of islands east of Biak. Although Biak played an important part during World War II and still has a large military presence, Pudaidori and the other small islands east of Biak bring promise of a tranquil tropical setting and a snorkeler’s delight. You may want to take the afternoon to relax on the white sandy beaches, swimiming and snorkelling, or looking for bird life ashore.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Auri Islands, Indonesia<br />\n</strong>The Cenderawasih Marine Park features over 15,000km2 of relatively undisturbed marine and coastal habitat and the extensive coral reefs rank amongst the finest in the world. Cenderawasih is renowned for its diversity of coral reef fish species, including numerous species of butterfly fish, angelfish, damselfish, parrotfish, rabbitfish and anemone fish.</p>\n<p>Cenderawasih (Bird-of-Paradise) Bay encompasses the Auri Islands offering some of the most beautiful clear-water snorkeling in the huge bay. The dozen or so islands have white sand beaches and excellent reefs. Auri’s spectacular karst islands also merit Zodiac cruises to explore the geological formations. One snorkel site has a trio of American WWII planes sunk in formation in only a few meters of water.</p>\n<p>Cenderawasih Marine Park is known for congregating whale sharks. As the biggest fish in the sea, they feed exclusively on the smallest planktonic creatures, growing to more than 12 meters in length. While there are other places in the world where snorkelers can seek a close encounter with these gentle giants, in Cenderawasih Bay the whale sharks tend to linger close to the surface for extended periods. They have become accustomed to taking small fish that spill from the nets of local fishermen. \n  <br />\n  <strong></strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 11 — Pulau Roon, Indonesia<br />\n</strong>Pulau Roon is just south of the Auri Islands. Closer to the mainland, its twisted coastline has many secluded bays and sandy beaches with the potential for excellent snorkeling on shallow offshore reefs. Pulau Roon is also peppered with small villages that might warrant an impromptu visit by Zodiac to connect with local people in an authentic and spontaneous interaction that can only be achieved on an expedition such as ours. &nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — At Sea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nWhile <em>Silver Discoverer</em> rounds the northwest tip of New Guinea, known as the Bird’s Head, our lecturers will take some time today to prepare you for the Raja Ampat and coastal Papua. More entertaining and relevant than many university lectures, the choice of presentations on offer through the day will no doubt stimulate both thought and conversation aboard the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 — Misool, Indonesia</strong> <br />\nThe Raja Ampat region of West Papua, with its multiple islands and intricate system of reefs lies in the heart of the Coral Triangle. This region has been called the most biodiverse area of ocean on the planet. <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor amongst small islands just off the coast of the larger Misool Island, and the Expedition Team will scout the best reef and beach combination for your visit.</p>\n<p>Steep coral walls and drop-offs are festooned with table corals, staghorn corals, and orange and purple sea squirts. We hope to see giant clams nestled into the coral formations while fish in rainbow colors sprinkle the reef above. From confetti-size inhabitants amongst the branching staghorn corals, to enormous solitary bumphead parrotfish this will be another snorkeler’s delight. Beach activities and bird watching will be on offer too.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 — Den Weg Islands, Indonesia</strong> <br />\nOn the southern shore of the Fakfak Peninsula are several karst islands that brought international interest in the 1930s thanks to extensive fields of ancient rock art that were found here. We will take our Zodiacs to explore several of the islands and will have a close look at the most accessible wall paintings that almost resemble Aboriginal motives from the Dreamtime. Depending on local permits we might also be allowed to visit one of the smaller villages and have a look at day-to-day modern life.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 15 — Triton Bay and Auiduma Island, Indonesia</strong> <br />\nIn 2008, the Kaimana Regency declared a 6000 km² Marine Protected Area around the waters of Triton Bay. The non-profit organization, Conservation International, maintains an office in Kaimana and a field station out in Triton Bay where visiting scientists can do their work. The marine biodiversity is second to none and the area offers everything from the tiniest pygmy seahorses to large and graceful whale sharks. The Expedition Team will select a prime spot for swimming and snorkeling within the bay.&nbsp; In addition, we hope to pay a visit to remote Auiduma Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 16 — Kai Archipelago, Indonesia</strong> <br />\nKai Islands will be our final opportunity to meet local people and to take to the water on this voyage. Depending on the conditions (and permits that are granted), we may choose to visit a village first, or to have a relaxing day in the water and on the beach to cap off this adventure in and around New Guinea.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 17 — At Sea</strong> <br />\nAs the miles peel away in our churning wake, you may wish to take advantage of one last fascinating lecture series, or perhaps you want to take time out to edit the many photos you have taken during the voyage. Regardless of how you spend the day, be sure to attend the screening of our Videographer’s final video recap of the voyage.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 18 — Darwin, Australia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> <br />\nFollowing breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer.</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia</strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Discoverer</em> for this stunning Silversea Expedition — Kimberley Coast Expedition. This afternoon, you will participate in a mandatory safety drill before departing Darwin. Later you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and attend a Zodiac briefing. We invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — At Sea, Cruising the Arafura Sea</strong><br />\n  A leisurely day at sea permits you to unwind after your travels, to learn your way around the ship, and to take advantage of the amenities aboard&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer.</em>&nbsp;Perhaps attend a lecture to prepare you for the fascinating Dreamtime mythology of the Aborigines, or relax in the comfort of your suite to watch a movie on the in-suite interactive television.<br />\n  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 3 — Jaco Island, Timor Leste</strong><br />\n  Timor is the easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands, and while the western part belongs to Indonesia, the eastern part gained independence in 2002 as Timor Leste. Our goal today is to enjoy Jaco Island off the eastern tip of Timor. Nobody lives on the island, as it is not only part of the Nino Konis Santana National Park, but also considered sacred by the Timorese.&nbsp; <em>Silver Discoverer</em>&nbsp;will anchor off its shore and we will enjoy the island, its forest, its beaches and its reef to have water activities offered. If conditions permit, a beach BBQ will be offered.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — At Sea, Cruising the Arafura Sea</strong><br />\nThis leisurely day at sea will give you a chance to attend more lectures about the natural history, wildlife and human history of the Kimberley area. All members of the Expedition Team are experts in their fields and will love to entertain you with stories and information that will make your voyage all the more interesting and fulfilling.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Wyndham, Bungle Bungle, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\nWyndham is our gateway to the breathtaking Bungle Bungle mountain range in Purnululu National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. For more than 350 million years, nature has shaped the geological formations of giant orange and black striped domes rising out of the ground to form a landscape unlike anything you have ever seen. Known to the local aborigines for thousands of years, the Bungles were only discovered by the outside world in the mid-1980s. Today, take part in an inclusive overflight for an aerial view of these glorious panoramas, as well as seeing the majestic man-made Lake Argyle and Argyle Diamond Mine area from the air.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can take a river cruise on the Ord River, looking for freshwater crocodiles, fruit-bats, short-eared rock wallabies and a variety of birds, including Mangrove Herons and Mangrove Gerygones.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 6-10 — Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  The Kimberley is famous for having one of the largest tidal ranges in the world. A flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of this natural phenomenon. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on tide, weather and sea conditions. Here are some of the places we may visit during our time in this wondrous region:<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>-Nares Point, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\nNares Point is a long finger of sandstone protruding from the mainland alongside Koolan Island. With its convoluted photogenic rock formations, this is a superb location for Zodiac exploration with our naturalists.</p>\n<p><strong>-Talbot Bay (Horizontal Falls), Buccaneer Archipelago, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\nDavid Attenborough described Horizontal Falls as “one of the greatest natural wonders of the world“. The region’s tides of close to 36 feet create an amazing spectacle. You can experience firsthand the incredible tidal power by boarding a 900hp fast boat and taking an exhilarating ride through the Horizontal Waterfalls. Depending on whether the tides are ebbing or flowing, we will also board our Zodiacs for a ride through the falls to continue deeper into the sandstone gorge of Cyclone Creek and to explore the geological formations that were created over the last two billion years.</p>\n<p><strong>-Montgomery Reef, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  At Montgomery Reef, which is 154 square miles in size, we can observe the amazing tidal changes that take place here. Timing of the tides is everything; low tide reveals up to 13 feet of reef exposing a river that allows access to this amazing semi-submerged world. As the tide continues to ebb, we use our Zodiacs to make our way to the edge of the reef where we are surrounded by cascading waterfalls up to 10 feet high and continue up the river as we look at the abundance of reef birds and sea creatures including turtles and manta rays. A visit to Montgomery Reef is very much tide-depending, but truly a once in a lifetime experience.</p>\n<p><strong>-Raft Point, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  Raft Point is home to indigenous Wandjina paintings. We will zodiac ashore and set out towards the top of Raft Point. Our hike takes us through abundant Kimberley Flora including the iconic boab tree. Upon reaching the top of Raft Point, enjoy the spectacular views of the bay in the shade of the overhanging cliff, which is home to the Wandjina Spirit and many other Dreamtime stories and images representing daily aboriginal life. Take a seat, or lie on your back and take in the Wandjina Spirit and listen to the Dreamtime stories associated with this extremely important Aboriginal spirit.</p>\n<p><strong>-Freshwater Cove, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  At Freshwater Cove we will be welcomed on the beach by Aboriginal guides with a traditional ochre welcome. Immediately afterwards we will be immersed in Wandjina culture with a walk amongst the rock formations that represent spiritual ancestors, and hear the story of the great Wandjina battle. From there the walk crosses a tidal creek and makes its way through the woodland forest.&nbsp; The highlight of the walk is a unique <em>Jungurim </em>(Boab tree) and its culturally significant carvings from long ago. On the return to the beach, we will have a look at the artists’ shelter where one can relax, share a cup of tea and damper with the artists and peruse their paintings. These paintings based on Dreamtime stories and motives are available for purchase from the artists. The farewell will be a traditional smoking ceremony on the beach at Wijingarra Bard Bard. </p>\n<p><strong>-Hunter River, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  The Hunter River is home to an immense mangrove. The image of the Indian Head in the soaring red sandstone cliffs will guide us as we set out in Zodiacs to explore the narrow mangrove channels, watching for numerous bird species and keeping an eye out for saltwater crocodiles, the most aggressive crocodile known to man.</p>\n<p>For those wishing to explore some of the Kimberley’s vast interior your onboard Silversea Expeditions team can arrange an optional helicopter flightseeing excursion to the famous Mitchell Falls Plateau and Mitchell Falls where four tiers of waterfalls plunge into deep pools that flow out into the Mitchell River.</p>\n<p><strong>-King George River &amp; Falls, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  The King George Falls is one of the Kimberley’s most magnificent natural wonders. At 260 feet the twin cascades are among the highest in Australia. We drop anchor at the mouth of the river and ride Zodiacs up this waterway, weaving through an amazing landscape of near vertical red rock formations and also looking for wildlife — saltwater crocodiles and a variety of birdlife, including giant raptors and the Brahminy Kite.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Broome, Western Australia</strong><br />\nEmbark <em>Silver Discoverer </em>for this stunning Silversea Expedition — Kimberley Coast Exploration. Before departure you will take part in a mandatory safety drill. &nbsp;This afternoon, meet your Expedition Team and attend a Zodiac briefing. Tonight we invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers, and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 2-6 — Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\nThe Kimberley is famous for having one of the largest tidal ranges in the world. A flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of this natural phenomenon. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on tide, weather and sea conditions. Here are some of the places we may visit during our time in this wondrous region:</p>\n<p><strong>-Nares Point, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  Nares Point is a long finger of sandstone protruding from the mainland alongside Koolan Island. With its convoluted photogenic rock formations, this is a superb location for Zodiac exploration and beach walks with our naturalists.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>-Talbot Bay (Horizontal Falls), Buccaneer Archipelago, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\nThe Horizontal Falls have been described as “one of the greatest natural wonders of the world.” The region’s tides of close to 36 feet create an amazing spectacle. One can experience firsthand the incredible tidal power boarding our 900 hp fast boat and speeding through the Horizontal Waterfalls in an exhilarating ride. Depending on whether the tides are ebbing or flowing, we will also board our Zodiacs for a ride through the falls to then continue deeper into the sandstone gorge of Cyclone Creek and explore the geological formations that were created over the last two billion years.</p>\n<p><strong>-Montgomery Reef, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  At Montgomery Reef, which is over 154 square miles in size, we can observe the amazing tidal changes that take place here. Timing of the tides is everything: low tide reveals up to 13 feet of reef exposing a river that allows access to this amazing semi-submerged world. As the tide continues to ebb, we use our Zodiacs to make our way to the edge of the reef where we are surrounded by cascading waterfalls up to 10 feet high, and continue up the river as we look at the abundance of reef birds and sea creatures including turtles and manta rays. A visit to Montgomery Reef is very tide-depending but truly a once in a lifetime experience.</p>\n<p><strong>-Freshwater Cove, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  At Freshwater Cove we will be welcomed on the beach by Aboriginal guides with a traditional ochre welcome. Immediately afterwards we will be immersed in Wandjina culture with a walk amongst the rock formations that represent spiritual ancestors, and hear the story of the great Wandjina battle. From there the walk crosses a tidal creek and makes its way through the woodland forest.&nbsp; The highlight of the walk is a unique <em>Jungurim </em>(Boab tree) and its culturally significant carvings from long ago. On the return to the beach, we will have a look at the artists’ shelter where one can relax, share a cup of tea and damper with the artists and peruse their paintings. These paintings based on Dreamtime stories and motives are available for purchase from the artists. The farewell will be a traditional smoking ceremony on the beach at Wijingarra Bard Bard. </p>\n<p><strong>-Hunter River, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  The Hunter River is home to an immense mangrove system. Be sure to look for the image of the Indian Head in the soaring red sandstone cliffs as we set out in Zodiacs to explore the narrow mangrove channels, watching for numerous bird species and keeping an eye out for the saltwater crocodile, the most aggressive crocodile known to man.</p>\n<p>For those wishing to explore some of the Kimberley’s vast interior your onboard Silversea Expeditions team can arrange an optional helicopter flightseeing excursion to the famous Mitchell Falls where four tiers of waterfalls plunge into deep pools that flow out into the Mitchell River.</p>\n<p><strong>-King George River &amp; Falls, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  The King George Falls is one of the Kimberley’s most magnificent natural wonders. At 260 feet, the twin cascades are among the highest in Australia. We drop anchor at the mouth of the river and ride Zodiacs up this waterway, weaving through an amazing landscape of near vertical red rock formations and looking for wildlife — carnivorous saltwater crocodiles as well as the amazing birdlife, including giant raptors and the Brahminy Kite. Arriving at the falls, we can cruise quite close to the base to contemplate the immensity of this spectacle — the force of the waterfall depends on seasonal rain.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Wyndham (Bungle Bungle), Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\nWyndham is our gateway to the breathtaking Bungle Bungle mountain range in Purnululu National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. For more than 350 million years, nature has shaped geological formations of giant orange and black striped domes rising out of the ground, unlike any other landscape ever seen. Today take part in an inclusive overflight for an aerial view of these glorious panoramas, as well as seeing the majestic man-made Lake Argyle and Argyle Diamond Mine area from the air. </p>\n<p>Alternatively you can take a river cruise on the Ord River, looking for freshwater crocodiles, fruit-bats, short-eared rock wallabies and a variety of birds, including Mangrove Herons and Mangrove Gerygones.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — At Sea, Cruising the Arafura Sea</strong><br />\nA leisurely day at sea permits you to take advantage of the amenities aboard&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer.</em>&nbsp;Perhaps attend a lecture to recap the fascinating Dreamtime mythology of the Aborigines, or relax in the comfort of your suite to watch a movie on the in-suite interactive television.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Jaco Island, Timor Leste&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  Timor is the easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands, and while the western part belongs to Indonesia, the eastern part gained independence in 2002 as Timor Leste. Our goal today is to enjoy Jaco Island off the eastern tip of Timor. Uninhabited Jaco Island is not only part of the Nino Konis Santana National Park, but is also considered sacred by the Timorese.&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer</em>&nbsp;will anchor off its shore so that we can enjoy the island, its forest, its beaches and its reef. If conditions permit, a beach BBQ will be offered.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — At Sea, Cruising the Arafura Sea</strong><br />\nThis last leisurely day at sea will give you a chance to exchange emails with fellow travelers and to attend final lectures about the natural history, wildlife and human history of the area. Our onboard Videographer/Photographer will also present the Voyage-DVD, letting you re-live the many moments of outstanding nature experiences had during this voyage “Kimberley Coast Exploration.”</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia</strong><br />\nFollowing breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity.

All members of the Expedition Team are experts in their fields and will love to entertain you with stories and information that will make your voyage all the more interesting and fulfilling.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Wyndham, Bungle Bungle, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\nWyndham is our gateway to the breathtaking Bungle Bungle mountain range in Purnululu National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. For more than 350 million years, nature has shaped the geological formations of giant orange and black striped domes rising out of the ground to form a landscape unlike anything you have ever seen. Known to the local aborigines for thousands of years, the Bungles were only discovered by the outside world in the mid-1980s. Today, take part in an inclusive overflight for an aerial view of these glorious panoramas, as well as seeing the majestic man-made Lake Argyle and Argyle Diamond Mine area from the air.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can take a river cruise on the Ord River, looking for freshwater crocodiles, fruit-bats, short-eared rock wallabies and a variety of birds, including Mangrove Herons and Mangrove Gerygones.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 6-10 — Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  The Kimberley is famous for having one of the largest tidal ranges in the world. A flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of this natural phenomenon. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on tide, weather and sea conditions. Here are some of the places we may visit during our time in this wondrous region:<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>-Nares Point, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\nNares Point is a long finger of sandstone protruding from the mainland alongside Koolan Island. With its convoluted photogenic rock formations, this is a superb location for Zodiac exploration with our naturalists.</p>\n<p><strong>-Talbot Bay (Horizontal Falls), Buccaneer Archipelago, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\nDavid Attenborough described Horizontal Falls as “one of the greatest natural wonders of the world“. The region’s tides of close to 36 feet create an amazing spectacle. You can experience firsthand the incredible tidal power by boarding a 900hp fast boat and taking an exhilarating ride through the Horizontal Waterfalls. Depending on whether the tides are ebbing or flowing, we will also board our Zodiacs for a ride through the falls to continue deeper into the sandstone gorge of Cyclone Creek and to explore the geological formations that were created over the last two billion years.</p>\n<p><strong>-Montgomery Reef, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  At Montgomery Reef, which is 154 square miles in size, we can observe the amazing tidal changes that take place here. Timing of the tides is everything; low tide reveals up to 13 feet of reef exposing a river that allows access to this amazing semi-submerged world. As the tide continues to ebb, we use our Zodiacs to make our way to the edge of the reef where we are surrounded by cascading waterfalls up to 10 feet high and continue up the river as we look at the abundance of reef birds and sea creatures including turtles and manta rays. A visit to Montgomery Reef is very much tide-depending, but truly a once in a lifetime experience.</p>\n<p><strong>-Raft Point, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  Raft Point is home to indigenous Wandjina paintings. We will zodiac ashore and set out towards the top of Raft Point. Our hike takes us through abundant Kimberley Flora including the iconic boab tree. Upon reaching the top of Raft Point, enjoy the spectacular views of the bay in the shade of the overhanging cliff, which is home to the Wandjina Spirit and many other Dreamtime stories and images representing daily aboriginal life. Take a seat, or lie on your back and take in the Wandjina Spirit and listen to the Dreamtime stories associated with this extremely important Aboriginal spirit.</p>\n<p><strong>-Freshwater Cove, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  At Freshwater Cove we will be welcomed on the beach by Aboriginal guides with a traditional ochre welcome. Immediately afterwards we will be immersed in Wandjina culture with a walk amongst the rock formations that represent spiritual ancestors, and hear the story of the great Wandjina battle. From there the walk crosses a tidal creek and makes its way through the woodland forest.&nbsp; The highlight of the walk is a unique <em>Jungurim </em>(Boab tree) and its culturally significant carvings from long ago. On the return to the beach, we will have a look at the artists’ shelter where one can relax, share a cup of tea and damper with the artists and peruse their paintings. These paintings based on Dreamtime stories and motives are available for purchase from the artists. The farewell will be a traditional smoking ceremony on the beach at Wijingarra Bard Bard. </p>\n<p><strong>-Hunter River, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  The Hunter River is home to an immense mangrove. The image of the Indian Head in the soaring red sandstone cliffs will guide us as we set out in Zodiacs to explore the narrow mangrove channels, watching for numerous bird species and keeping an eye out for saltwater crocodiles, the most aggressive crocodile known to man.</p>\n<p>For those wishing to explore some of the Kimberley’s vast interior your onboard Silversea Expeditions team can arrange an optional helicopter flightseeing excursion to the famous Mitchell Falls Plateau and Mitchell Falls where four tiers of waterfalls plunge into deep pools that flow out into the Mitchell River.</p>\n<p><strong>-King George River &amp; Falls, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  The King George Falls is one of the Kimberley’s most magnificent natural wonders. At 260 feet the twin cascades are among the highest in Australia. We drop anchor at the mouth of the river and ride Zodiacs up this waterway, weaving through an amazing landscape of near vertical red rock formations and also looking for wildlife — saltwater crocodiles and a variety of birdlife, including giant raptors and the Brahminy Kite. Arriving at the falls, we can cruise quite close to the base to contemplate the immensity of this spectacle — the force of the falls is very much depending on seasonal rainfalls.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Broome, Western Australia</strong><br />\nFollowing breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

We will Zodiac ashore and set out towards the top of Raft Point. Our hike will take us through abundant flora including the iconic boab tree, also known by the local Aboriginals as the “upside down tree”. Upon reaching the top of Raft Point, enjoy the spectacular views of the bay in the shade of the overhanging cliff, which is home to the Wandjina Spirit and many other Dreamtime stories and images representing daily aboriginal life. Take a seat, or lie on your back and take in the Wandjina Spirit and listen to the dreamtime stories associated with this extremely important Aboriginal spirit.</p>\n<p><strong>-Hunter River, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  The Hunter River is home to an immense mangrove system that dates back over 2 billion years. The image of the Indian Head in the soaring red sandstone cliffs will guide us as we set out in Zodiacs to explore the narrow mangrove channels, watching for numerous bird species and keeping an eye out for the saltwater crocodile, the most aggressive crocodile known to man. We will also look for the Ospreys that are known to nest here. For those wishing to explore some of the Kimberley's vast interior, your onboard Silversea Expeditions team can arrange an optional helicopter flightseeing excursion to the famous Mitchell Falls where four tiers of waterfalls plunge into deep pools that flow out into the Mitchell River.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>-King George River &amp; Falls, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\n  The King George Falls is one of the Kimberley's most magnificent natural wonders. At 260 feet (80 m), the twin cascades are among the highest in Australia. We drop anchor at the mouth of the river and ride Zodiacs up this waterway, weaving through an amazing landscape of near vertical red rock formations and a parade of wildlife — carnivorous saltwater crocodiles, amazing birdlife including giant raptors and the Brahminy Kite. Arriving at the falls, we can cruise quite close to the base to contemplate the immensity of this spectacle.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 7 — Wyndham (Bungle Bungle), Kimberley, Western Australia</strong><br />\nWyndham is our gateway to the breath-taking Bungle Bungle mountain range in Purnululu National Park, a World Heritage Site. For more than 350 million years, nature has shaped geological formations of giant orange and black striped domes rising out of the ground. It is a landscape unlike anything you have ever seen. Known to the local aborigines for hundreds of years, the Bungles were only discovered by the outside world in the mid-1980s. </p>\n<p>Today, take part in an inclusive overflight for an aerial view of these glorious panoramas, as well as the majestic, man-made Lake Argyle and Argyle Diamond Mine. Alternatively you can take a river cruise on the Ord River, looking for freshwater crocodiles, fruit-bats, short-eared rock wallabies and a variety of birds, including Mangrove Herons and Mangrove Gerygones.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 8 — Cruising the Timor Sea</strong><br />\n  A leisurely day at sea will permit you to take advantage of the luxurious amenities and wellness program offered aboard <em>Silver Discoverer</em>. Attend a lecture recapping our experience in the Kimberley, or perhaps one preparing you for the fascinating Indonesian islands and cultures on the horizon. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 9 — Seba, Savu, Indonesia</strong><br />\n  During the morning the <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will steaming closer to the island of Savu. As we approach, you might want to attend a talk by one of our lecturers. Another option might be to learn more about taking and editing photos, by attending a photography seminar. <br />\n  <br />\n  Shortly before noon, we hope to arrive in front of Savu. This little island is one of the most interesting destinations in the Sunda Islands. The tradition of textile weaving remains strong, with the women still growing the cotton, hand dyeing and weaving on back-strap looms. We will have a traditional village welcome with men and women dancing and singing. Both at the beach and in the village, we can see the men on horseback, showing off their adorned ponies and traditional clothes.  The Savunese plant predominantly corn, but derive their staple nutrition from the lontar palm. We will have the chance to see a lontar tapping demonstration. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 10 — Ende, Flores Island, Indonesia</strong><br />\n  One of Flores’ attractions is the Kelimutu National Park northeast of Ende. Landing on the southern side of Flores, we will almost completely circle the Kelimutu National Park in order to get to Mount Kelimutu, an active volcano. The site is spectacular, as Mount Kelimutu has three summit crater lakes, located one next to the other, each with varying colours. The lakes are even featured on the Indonesian 5,000 Rupiah bill. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 11 — Komodo and Pink Beach, Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia</strong><br />\nEarly risers may spot whales as we approach Komodo. <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor close to the National Park Headquarter, and Zodiacs will bring you ashore onto a floating jetty to reach the starting point of our hike. Walk along forested pathways in search of Komodo dragons. These enormous reptiles weigh up to 300 pounds. The surrounding forest is also home to ornate orchids, elegant Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, Helmeted Friarbirds, Orange-footed Megapodes, and Javan deer. Each walking group is accompanied by two local rangers who provide interpretation and help maintain a safe distance between the dragons and the visitors.</p>\n<p>During lunch, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will reposition to the spectacular Pink Beach for an afternoon of snorkeling or relaxing on the beach. You can see shimmering tropical fish such as the striped clown fish nestled among the protective tentacles of its sea anemone host, or a spotted grouper lazily swimming by a flamboyant sea fan. In addition to tropical fish at Pink Beach, rays have regularly been seen close to the neighbouring island of Pulau Punya.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 12 — Waikelo, Sumba, Lesser Sundas, Indonesia </strong><br />\n  Known for its intricate ikat fabric, distinctive architecture and sculptured stone tombs, Sumba has resisted the advances of the modern age. This makes it a fascinating island to explore, especially West Sumba where ancient tribal rites are best preserved. The Sumba culture revolves around villages where ancestors are worshipped by extended families living in enormous clan houses with high-pitched thatch roofs. The Sumbanese honour the dead by dragging massive stones a great distance to construct mausoleums for the departed. <br />\n  <br />\nWe will arrive early in the morning and will take our Zodiacs ashore. From the landing we expect to board small local buses in order to visit several villages. At one stop we will witness a funereal rite ceremony as well as a ‘Pasola’, a fierce martial arts performance on horseback. We will also observe the process of making Indonesia’s famous ikat textiles, and will have the opportunity to purchase ikat directly from the weavers.</p>\n<p>During the afternoon back aboard, the Videographer will present our voyage documentation. This is a perfect opportunity to relive all the wondrous moments you have had while exploring the Kimberley and some of the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 13 — Benoa, Indonesia </strong><br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.<br />\n</p>\n<p>Please Note: Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 – Benoa, Bali, Indonesia</strong><br />\n  After your arrival in Benoa, embark <em>Silver Discoverer</em> during the early afternoon. After settling in you will attend a mandatory safety drill and Zodiac briefing. After sail-away cocktails on the aft deck, important crew members and the Expedition Staff will be introduced to you. This evening, enjoy the first of many memorable culinary highlights in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 – Probolingo, Indonesia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nArriving in Probolingo around noon, we will disembark for a hike to Mount Bromo. From Probolingo we travel southwest to Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. Semeru and Bromo are active volcanos. Semeru is active on a periodical and fairly reliable schedule with activity about every 20 minutes. The eerie landscape of the park has nurtured legends and myths, and the Tengger people believe that a prince sacrificed his life for his family at Mount Bromo. In a somewhat more humane way, the people here appease the Gods once a year during the annual <em>Kasada</em> festival where offerings of vegetables, chickens and money are thrown into the crater of the volcano. </p>\n<p>At 2392 meters high, Mt Bromo is not among Indonesia’s tallest mountains, but its beauty lies in its incredible setting.&nbsp;Mt Bromo sits in the Tengger caldera, surrounded by the “Sea of Sand.” Sulphurous smoke rises from Mount Bromo while Mt Semeru is smoking in the distance.&nbsp;Walking is the best way to experience Mount Bromo, but you can take ponies across the Sea of Sand to the bottom of the steep stairs (200 steps) that lead to the crater. At the base of Mount Bromo and amidst the Sea of Sand is the <em>Poten</em>, a Tenggerese Hindu temple.</p>\n<p>Before returning to <em>Silver Discoverer,</em> a snack will be served at the Bromo Restaurant. From here you will enjoy a last look at Mount Bromo in the distance.<br />\n  &nbsp;<br />\n  <strong>Day 3 – Sumenep, Madura, Indonesia</strong><br />\n  A special dance will be performed to welcome us to Sumenep on the island of Madura.&nbsp; It is known as the <em>Muangsangkal</em> which literally translates to, “throwing unhappiness away.” Located slightly northeast of Surabaya, Sumenep has some interesting sites. Besides historical places such as the Keraton (Palace) and its tiny Museum, there is also the Great Mosque built in 1763.&nbsp; The Keraton Sumenep consists of the old and the new Palace and the adjacent Sare Park. The museum holds antique weapons, ceremonial tools and jewellery, as well as some of the uniforms and furniture used by the different kings. Probably the most unusual object is the golden carriage the Queen of England gave the Sumenep King. Built one year later than the Palace, the Great Mosque shows the influence of Islamic, Chinese and European style, making this building unique, specifically with its beautiful gate. </p>\n<p>The island is also known and even famous for its carvings, <em>kris</em> production and textiles. Madura batik has different characteristics compared to the Javanese style and usually boasts clear, strong colours such as red, green and yellow with birds, flowers and dragons as motifs. Madura is also known for its bull racing, which is usually done on an annual basis. Originating with the ploughing of fields, a competition started to see who had the strongest animals. Today these bulls are kept for prestige and are extremely well looked after. A variety of special fodder is prepared including corn, beans, soybean leafs, grass, a mixture of traditional spices, eggs and even beer.&nbsp; All are believed to strengthen the bulls.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 – Cruising the Java Sea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nOn our way to our next destination we will navigate along Java’s north coast, eventually leaving Jakarta on portside.&nbsp; While we cruise the Java Sea, our expedition team, comprised of experts in their fields will bring their subjects to life with presentations representing a wealth of experience. More entertaining and relevant than most university lectures, the choice of presentations on offer through the day will stimulate both thought and conversation aboard the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 – Anak Krakatoa, Indonesia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>Expedition Day</strong><br />\nDuring the morning, our little ship will reach the southwest tip of Java and the UNESCO World Heritage site of Ujung Kulon National Park. The National Park includes the Ujung Kulon Peninsula containing the largest remaining lowland rain forest on the Java plain, as well as the Natural Reserve of Krakatoa –which we will see in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>Over lunch, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> heads into the Sunda Strait to reach the area of one of the most dramatic volcanic eruptions in history. During the afternoon we intend to land on Anak Krakatoa, a volcano that rose above sea level in 1930 where Krakatoa originally stood and has grown continuously since the 1950s. As it is an active volcano, any landing today depends on the volcano’s activity levels, which also determine where we can step foot onto the black sand beaches littered with pumice. The dynamic fumaroles, old and new lava flows, subtly coloured rocks, and the volcano itself are stunning from shore or from the sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 – At Sea</strong><br />\n<em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be heading along the south-eastern end of Sumatra. &nbsp;After a leisurely breakfast, attend a seminar, perhaps take time to edit your photographs or learn to make some Indonesian food from the chef and his/her team. You may want to exercise in the Gym, visit the Spa, or simply relax on the outer decks where our naturalists will be scanning the horizon for seabirds and marine mammals.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 – Padang (for Cupek, Sumatra), Indonesia</strong><br />\nWe will drive from Padang to Cupek, a Minangkabau village in Sumatra’s interior. The ancestral homelands of the Minangkabau, devout Muslims, are centred in West Sumatra’s lush highlands and stretch as far as the seashore. Homes, rice paddies and the like pass from mother to daughter in this, the world’s largest matrilineal society.</p>\n<p>Visiting the village we will see a <em>rumah gadang</em>, or “big house,” known to be a traditional Minangkabau home intended to hold the extended family. Made of local Surian wood, it has an arched, buffalo-horn shaped roof and walls woven of bamboo, icons of the Minangkabau building style. With its long hall-like main room, it is not only used as a residence, but also sometimes for meetings and ceremonies. During our visit we will not only see a traditional wedding ceremony, but will be invited to join the parade of the Bride marching to the groom’s house accompanied by more than 100 women in traditional costume. </p>\n<p>A welcome dance will be performed and later you can enjoy some other traditional dances. A cooking demonstration will take place and you can learn how to prepare <em>rendang</em>.&nbsp; Crops like rice, cabbage, beans and the all-important chilies grow in abundance and the Minangnese are known for their spicy, sumptuous cuisine, which we will be able to savour during our local lunch ashore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 – Batu Islands, Indonesia</strong><br />\nWe will visit the Batu Islands, a group of roughly 50 islands that have a close connection to the famous Nias Islands. The islands are generally low and forested, mostly with coconut palms for copra production, and some forest products. The Batu (or Telos) Islands are located on the equator and are known worldwide to surfers for the special waves found along their shores. There are many other things to do here and we plan to stopover at one of the villages to gain an insight into local life. Bird-watching, hikes, and a Zodiac cruise might also be on offer at this expeditionary stop.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 – Bawomataluo, Nias Islands, Indonesia</strong><br />\nThe original Nias Islanders were said to be fierce, and different ceremonies recognizing stages throughout&nbsp; life required that animals be slaughtered or enemies killed. Therefore young men prepared to become warriors at an early age. One of the preparations was stone jumping, a ritual where youngsters jumped over 1.5 to 2-meter stone towers. It was basically part of warrior training, which led to the young boy becoming an adult if he jumped a specific height in warriors clothing.</p>\n<p>Still today, Nias boys start preparing&nbsp;for their stone jump from the age of ten. They symbolically become men by jumping over the stone tower, signifying that they are ready to assume the responsibilities of adulthood. Reaching the local village of Bawomataluo – a complex that is on the UNESCO World Heritage site tentative list – we will be met by the king of the village and enjoy a cultural performance including the War Dance. This is performed to enhance the spirit of the ancestors before war and we hope to see the local young men perform the traditional stone jumping. &nbsp;In addition to the cultural segment of the visit, birders will be looking for the Stork-billed Kingfisher and other birds.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 – Simeulue Islands, Sumatra, Indonesia&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>Expedition Day</strong><br />\n<em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be at anchor today in the Simeulue Islands, a group of 57 islands. More than 80,000 inhabitants live in the islands (the largest, Big Simeulue, being 100 kms long) and make a living largely from farming and fishing. The islands are covered in forest, have beaches, caves, two lakes and even a waterfall. The inhabitants live a traditional lifestyle and the local culture is still important. The Simeulue Islands are known for black magic, practiced by <em>dukun</em> –shaman or healers that can cause damage and heal. Cultural events include performances of <em>nandong</em> (poetry singing) and <em>debus</em>, or traditional dancing. Magic is performed on stage in which the performers use sharp objects to cut or stab themselves without getting hurt. The islands are also famous for their dragon boat teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 – Pulau We and Banda Aceh, Indonesia</strong><br />\nLocated above the very northern tip of Sumatra, the island of Pulau We and its main port of Sabang used to be an important coaling station in former days. &nbsp;During the morning we will visit Sabang, walking through town to see some of the old Dutch Colonial buildings and the trees imported from Suriname by the Dutch. Continue to We’s south to see the geothermal and volcanic Valley of Jaboi where we will spend some time at the fumaroles in quiet isolation while admiring the panoramic views of the island. </p>\n<p>During lunch, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will reposition to Banda Aceh. Banda Aceh, the capital of Banda Province, was severely hit by a tsunami in 2004 and we can see the power of nature through the PLTD <em>Apung</em>, a former floating power plant, which was moved by tsunami several kilometres inland despite its weight of 780 tons.&nbsp; The structure now acts as a monument in a park that interprets the tsunami damage. Here there is an old DC-3 representing Indonesia’s struggle for independence and a Tsunami Museum. </p>\n<p>After the tsunami certain cultural traits which formerly were only allowed to be performed by men were taught to women as well, among them special dances. One of the dances popularly practiced in Aceh province is the Saman. Dancers sit in a row and perform elaborative movements with their hands, heads and torsos, and the choreography includes clapping and hitting the body with the hands, resulting in percussive sounds that add to the performance.&nbsp;These movements symbolize the daily lives of the Gayo people and their natural environment. The Saman is performed to celebrate national and religious holidays, cementing relationships between village groups. We hope to see a presentation with male Sufi dancers in colorful costumes dancing just for us.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 – At Sea and Belawan (for Gunung Leuser NP), Indonesia</strong><br />\nHeading down the northeast coast of Sumatra, our lecturers will provide presentations on various fascinating topics and will prepare you for our encounter with Sumatra’s wildlife.</p>\n<p>In the evening, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will go alongside in Belawan, Sumatra’s busiest port. Built originally to export tobacco, rubber and later palm oil, Belawan today is an important port for container ships exporting coffee and tea along with a slew of other locally produced goods.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 – Belawan (for Gunung Leuser NP), Indonesia</strong><br />\nFor us Belawan is the gate to Gunung Leuser National Park. Located in the interior of Sumatra, running along the Barisan mountain-ridge, the park covers an area of some 9000 square kilometers. It is likely one of Indonesia’s oldest (and possibly least visited) parks, and is part of the endangered UNESCO World Heritage site “Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra.”</p>\n<p>Before visiting the Bukit Lawang Visitor Centre to learn about the flora and fauna of the park, we will have breakfast at the Rindu Alam Restaurant. We will be briefed by a ranger about our visit and hike for two hours in the park. The former Bohorok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre has released more than 200 of the Sumatran orangutan back into the wild. The center has closed, but you can still see orangutans in the wild. Apart from the Sumatran orangutan there are eight other primate species present in the park. We hope to see several during our forest walk.</p>\n<p>After our walk, lunch awaits us at Rindu Alam before returning to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> in the late afternoon.</p>\n<p>  <strong>Day 14 – Crossing the Malacca Strait and Phuket, Thailand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  After a leisurely breakfast, attend the last of our lectures preparing you for Phuket and Thailand. <br />\n  Otherwise spend time on the outer decks, keep an eye out for wildlife or watch the ships that have to use the Malacca Strait to get into the Indian Ocean or are heading for Singapore. During the afternoon, our onboard Videographer will present the Voyage-DVD, showing the many interesting and captivating moments of the voyage. </p>\n<p>  <strong>Day 15 – Phuket, Thailand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity. Expedition Team members scheduled for this voyage are subject to change or cancellation.</em></p>\n<p><strong>360 DEGREES OF GIVING</strong> <br />\nThey say it’s better to give than to receive, luckily we have the opportunity to do both. The friendly villagers we visit throughout our expedition welcome us with such warm hearts, and we receive so much from them, that we want to make sure we’re giving right back.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of goodwill, we greatly encourage you to help us support the local communities we will be visiting. Gifts may consist of second-hand children’s clothing, school supplies (pencils, pens, and writing tablets), and medical supplies (Band-Aids, antiseptic wipes, and first aid items). Supplies received will be collected on board by the Expedition Team and evenly distributed throughout the villages as we visit.</p>\n<p><strong>GEAR UP</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not sure what to wear while onboard? <a style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http://www.shiptoshoretraveler.com/silversea\">Visit our shop and gear up</a>.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Colombo, Sri Lanka</strong><br />\n  Arrive in Colombo and embark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>. Settle in and attend a mandatory safety drill before leaving port. During the afternoon you will be introduced to some of the important crew members and your Expedition Team. In the evening the Restaurant Manager and Executive Chef would like to invite you to enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 2 — Galle, Sri Lanka</strong><br />\nToday we plan to depart for an excursion to a nearby tea estate for a complete tea experience. The tour of the tea estate will introduce you to the fascinating process of tea production, starting from the picking tea leaves by local women to the weighing, processing and packaging at the factory. A tea tasting will follow to give you the opportunity to sample the varieties available. </p>\n<p>Later in the morning we will explore the ancient Muslim port of Galle. Different political influences from Europe are evident in Galle Fort, which was occupied by the Portuguese, Dutch and British up until the late 19th century. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988, it is surrounded by the sea on three sides. Walking along the narrow streets one can best absorb the atmosphere of this living fort. Along these same narrow streets some of the colonial Dutch architecture has survived. The 18th century Dutch church has a splendid wooden memorial to one of the commanders of Galle, but we will also see the Arab quarter with its distinctly Moorish touch. </p>\n<p>For lunch, we will drive to Unawatuna Beach Resort at one of Sri Lanka’s best beaches for a distinctive local seafood barbecue accompanied by Sri Lankan Baila musicians. The resort also offers you a chance to enjoy a dip in the ocean.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 3 — Kirinda and Hambantota, Sri Lanka</strong><br />\nKirinda is located just south of the Yala (Ruhuna) National Park — our main point of interest for the day. Yala’s history as a wildlife sanctuary goes back more than 114 years and it was declared a National Park in 1938. Situated in the southeast of Sri Lanka, the park covers 979 square kilometres. A wide variety of wild animals live in the park, including one of the highest densities of leopards in the world. Of the 215 bird species known six are endemic. Its importance for birds is shown through the Kumana Bird Sanctuary. Yala has a variety of ecosystems — from moist monsoon forests to marine wetlands — so not only birders will want to visit this exceptional National Park, and home to Sri Lankan elephants.</p>\n<p>While in the park, enjoy a Champagne forest brunch with a renowned Sri Lankan naturalist who will offer a brief lecture on the ornithological and ecological importance of Yala National Park. Following the day’s activities we return to the ship and carry on to Hambantota.</p>\n<p>Hambantota is one of the gateways to Sri Lanka. Rich in resources it is moving progressively into a central role in the development of the southern region of Sri Lanka. Traditionally an agricultural area, the region is also known for having some of the country’s most skilled jewelers and crafts people. We will briefly stop in Hambantota to clear out of the country.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 4 — At Sea, Cruising the Indian Ocean</strong><br />\n  Make full use of our small, manoeuvrable ship while we cover the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean. Our lecturers will offer talks preparing you for our visit to the Maldives, be it about the historical aspects or natural history. In addition you can unwind, relax, and make use of the gym or Spa, and other amenities <em>Silver Discoverer</em> has on offer.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 5 — Uligamu Island, Maldives</strong><br />\nUligamu is one of the northernmost inhabited islands of Haa Alif Atoll and the Maldives. Because of its location, the island is visited by many yachts on their way into or out of the Arabian Sea. The island has been selected as the first in the Maldives to use a combination of renewable energies via wind turbines and solar panels in a micro grid, providing the island more efficient and non-polluting energy.</p>\n<p>After <em>Silver Discoverer</em> is cleared into the Maldives in Uligamu, we will have an opportunity to look around this small community of some 300 inhabitants.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 6 — Hanifaru Bay, Baa Atoll, and Olhugiri, Baa Atoll, Maldives</strong><br />\nThe Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve comprises 75 islands, 13 of which are inhabited by a population of approximately 12,000 people. Corals are common in the area and Maldivian coral reefs support a high diversity of reef animals, including some 250 species of soft and hard corals and 1,200 reef and reef-associated fish species. Hawksbill and green turtles, manta rays, whale sharks and different species of seabirds use the reserve. Napoleon wrasses and tawny nurse sharks also frequent the area which was designated as a Marine Protected Area in 2009. </p>\n<p>Using our resources in true expedition style, we will explore the shallow lagoon, which includes a small vegetated sand cay is on the western corner of the reef. The lagoon is dominated by sand and has no direct channels to the ocean.  This makes it a favorite site for turtles and seabirds that nest ashore. On the south-eastern side, a small bay attracts marine megafauna, and at certain times over 250 individual manta rays and several whale sharks have been recorded actively feeding in this area – obviously, such numbers are exceptional.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, we will visit tiny Olhugiri, an uninhabited island located at the southern end of Baa Atoll. The island, lagoon and the surrounding reef area is all protected by law. Olhugiri is one of two islands in the entire Maldives that boasts regularly roosting frigatebirds, mainly Lesser Frigate (Fregata ariel), and Red-billed Tropicbirds. The island’s beaches are also used by turtles for nesting.<br />\n</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 – Male and Kuda Bandos, Maldives</strong><br />\nMale is one of the smallest capitals in the world in terms of its physical size, yet a third of the country’s population live in Male. Different from any other island in the country, Male is a city of high-rise buildings and paved roads. Government offices are centralized in one area and the main streets are lined with shops and offices. A stroll around the fish market and the local market at the northern waterfront offer an insight into the local trade of this area. </p>\n<p>Male also houses a handful of architectural gems that you will have an opportunity to see on our tour of the city. The Grand Friday Mosque opened in 1984, is one of the largest in South Asia admitting over 5000 people. Today, buildings around the city reflect its heritage. For example, the Sultans Palace was built to house the Presidents of the Maldives and is still used. The Sultan’s Park and national Museum are also highlights. Built over the remains of the old Sultans palace; the park is one of the few green spots in Male. The national Museum lies inside the park and houses many cultural artefacts, ranging from stone objects to fragments of royal antiquities from the Buddhist era to the rule of Islamic monarchs. </p>\n<p>During lunch, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will relocate five miles and thereby leave civilization behind. By early afternoon we want to go ashore at Kuda Bandos, a small and peaceful little sandy island. The uninhabited spot has perfect beaches and the snorkeling is spectacular. Unwind on the beach or continue your underwater explorations.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 8 — Maalhaveli, Meemu Atoll, Maldives</strong><br />\nAtolls are a geographical marvel, and Maldivian reefs are home to the richest biodiversity in the region. The Maldives account for 5% of the world’s reefs where thousands of fish swimming around the vivid corals can be just a few feet, sometimes just inches away from you.</p>\n<p>Meemu Atoll has a population of 6500 inhabitants who are concentrated on nine of its 33 islands. Set like pearls on a necklace, the islands circle the lagoon. This morning we will visit a small Maldivian paradise with palm-fringed beaches, mangroves and a reef for our snorkelers who will want to inspect to the underwater realm.<br />\n  <br />\n  Let our Marine Biologist(s) introduce and orient you to the wonders lying below the water, while our Ornithologist looks for terns, boobies, gulls and herons.  In fact, more than 160 species of birds are known in the Maldives.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 9 — Hithadhoo, Addu Atoll, Maldives</strong><br />\nThe Maldives are made up of 1190 islands, of which 200 are inhabited. Addu is the southernmost of the Maldives’ atolls and Addu City is one of only two cities in the Maldives. Since Addu is some 540 kilometres south of Male, there is even an international airport on Gan, one of Addu Atoll’s islands. </p>\n<p>Hithadoo is the westernmost part of Addu City and we have the morning to explore both land and sea. The Expedition Team will accompany you on walks looking for birds and other wildlife, while our marine biologist(s) will be there to show you some exceptional reefs and underwater creatures.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Days 10- 12 — At Sea</strong><br />\nTo cover the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean, we will be at sea for three days. Our lecturers will offer talks preparing you for our visit to the Seychelles. Attend seminars and workshops on offer, join discussions, relax on the outer decks, or make use of the Gym and Spa.</p>\n<p>Our Executive Chef and his or her team may offer demonstrations of the preparation of special culinary highlights, while the bar team will likely entertain and educate you further about wines and spirits.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 13 — Praslin, Seychelles</strong><br />\nArriving in the late morning, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be cleared into the Seychelles before we can explore Praslin Island. This is the site of the fabulous Vallée de Mai, one of Seychelles’ two UNESCO World Heritage Sites. We disembark via Zodiac to the picturesque Baie Ste Anne jetty. From here we drive up the scenic coastal road through a quaint fishing village and dense forest of contrasting shades of green, to Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve. </p>\n<p>With a population of 6,500 people, Praslin, Seychelles’ second largest island, measures only 10 km by 3.7 km. It has substantial tracts of tropical forests with over 6,000 Coco-de-Mer palms with enormous fan-shaped fronds. These trees can grow more than 100 feet tall, living 800-1,000 years, and are home to endemic birds, such as the Seychelles Bulbul and the Seychelles Black Parrot. During our walking tour, you will discover this mystical World Heritage Site famous for the Coco de Mer — the largest seed in the plant kingdom weighing up to 40 pounds. Capture the cathedral feel of this primeval forest and listen for the high pitched whistles of the Black Parrot. </p>\n<p>Later, we depart Vallee de Mai headed for the Cote d’Or Beach Here we have time for a swim or stroll along this beautiful beach before returning to the ship for the evening. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 14 — Aride and Curieuse, Seychelles</strong><br />\nAride is the northernmost island of the granitic Seychelles and is largely covered in native woodland, including the endemic Wright's Gardenia, a shrub with beautifully scented flowers found nowhere else in the world. In addition, the island hosts one of the most important seabird populations in the Indian Ocean, with more breeding species than any other island in the Seychelles. Over one million individual seabirds can be found breeding on Aride. This includes the world's largest colonies of Lesser Noddy and Tropical Shearwater, the world’s only hilltop colony of Sooty Terns, and the western Indian Ocean’s largest colony of Roseate Tern. The island also has the only breeding colony of Red-tailed Tropicbird east of Aldabra and huge numbers of Brown Noddy, White Tern and Wedge-tailed Shearwater. Thousands of Great Frigatebirds and Lesser Frigatebirds soar over the northern cliffs. </p>\n<p>During lunch <em>Silver Discoverer</em> repositions to Curieuse Island with its checkered and tragic history. Curieuse was a leper colony until 1965 and the doctor’s residence, which dates from the 1870s, is a museum and educational center today. More than 500 tortoises walk around the island amidst eight different species of mangrove trees. Birders will look for the Seychelles Black Parrot in rare and protected Coco de Mer trees. Whatever you choose to do on Curieuse Island, be sure to make the most of your final outing of the voyage.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 15 — Mahe, Seychelles</strong><br />\nAfter breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Mahe, Seychelles</strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Discoverer</em> and become acquainted with the outer decks and amenities found on board. After settling in, a mandatory safety drill will be held. Your Expedition Leader will then introduce some of the key personnel and the Expedition Team. Enjoy your first dinner aboard as the crew ready <em>Silver Discoverer</em> to drop her dock lines and head for Desroches. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 2 — Desroches Island, Seychelles </strong><br />\nDesroches is one of the Outer Islands and the main island of the Amirante group of the Seychelles. Located 230 km southwest of Mahé, it has a land area of only 3.24 km², but has a staggering 15 kilometers of fine sand beaches. The northern part of the island is a coconut plantation and farm, with a settlement on the far shore.  The first coconut plantations were started in 1875 and copra is still processed on the island before being transported to Mahé for export. After spending the morning exploring this beautiful beach, we plan to return to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> for lunch.</p>\n<p>During the late afternoon, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will start the voyage to spectacular Aldabra – a natural paradise on earth.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 3 — At Sea, Cruising the Indian Ocean</strong><br />\n  Make full use of our small, manoeuvrable ship while we start covering part of the Indian Ocean. Our lecturers will offer talks preparing you for our visit to the UNESCO World Heritage Site Aldabra. In addition, you can unwind, relax, and make use of the gym or Spa, or any of the other amenities <em>Silver Discoverer</em> can offer.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Days 4-5 — Aldabra, Seychelles </strong><br />\nFor two days <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor off Aldabra and we will have the opportunity to visit this remote part of the Seychelles’ Outer Islands. Aldabra is reputedly the world’s second-largest atoll and has been described as one of nature’s treasures. It will truly be a privilege to visit this UNESCO World Heritage Site. Due to its extreme isolation, Aldabra is virtually untouched by humans. Its distinctive island fauna includes the Aldabra giant tortoise. About two thirds of the world population of giant tortoises lives on Aldabra. As Aldabra lacks freshwater and is difficult to access, the island has not been developed for tourism. Only a handful of smaller ships with special permits are allowed to call at this unique atoll.</p>\n<p>We hope to enjoy exhilarating drift snorkels as the incoming tide whisks us into a lagoon populated with eagle rays, turtles, and coral gardens teeming with marine life. Time and tides permitting, we may cruise via Zodiac through narrow channels between fossilized coral islands, and between mangrove-covered islands to observe large colonies of nesting boobies and Great Frigatebirds soaring overhead. As the tides pump water in and out of the lagoon, massive numbers of fish come and go through channels to feed. We can snorkel in these same channels, allowing the current to carry us along in a magical scene.<br />\n  Conditions permitting, we will go ashore to visit the small research station on Picard Island and photograph the mighty tortoises living on this isolated island.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 6 — Cosmoledo, Seychelles</strong><br />\n  Cosmoledo is an atoll about 85 miles east of Aldabra. The atoll has more than 20 small islands and islets and has been repeatedly used by humans for the harvesting of local resources including guano and fish. Abandoned in 1992, the islands have recovered naturally, assisted by a conservation organization that works to eradicate introduced species. Cosmoledo is an Important Bird Area and we will see the Indian Ocean’s largest colony of Red-footed Boobies, the Seychelles’ largest colony of Sooty Terns, as well as Black-naped Terns, Crested terns and Red-tailed Tropicbirds.  If conditions cooperate, two narrow passes on the southern side will permit Zodiacs to enter the lagoon where several beaches wait to be explored. Here snorkelers will find an interesting underwater world to occupy their time. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 7 — Farquhar, Seychelles</strong><br />\n  The Farquhar Group is some 400 miles southwest of Mahe. Of this group, Farquhar Atoll is the southernmost. The two main islands of the atoll (Farquhar North and Farquhar South) look somewhat like a reined in sea horse, with the roads and an airstrip on North Island being the reins. North Island has a small settlement. We will scout the conditions today and decide where to go ashore by Zodiac to make use of North Island’s beaches and meet some rarely visited inhabitants. Hawksbill and green sea turtles come to the atoll to nest, and several of the Farquhar islands are Important Bird Areas. Goelettes, the southernmost of the atoll’s islets, holds Sooty Terns, Brown Noddies and Black-naped Terns.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 8 — Alphonse Island, Seychelles </strong><br />\n  Going north, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> is approaching civilization again. Some 220 miles south of Mahe is the 7-square mile Alphonse Atoll. Alphonse has one island – Alphonse Island – which in turn has one small airfield. Diving and sports fishing are the island’s main attractions, with a population of less than 100 residents mainly working in a small resort, fishing or farming. However, change is in the air as the Seychelles’ government plans to set up a pearl farm, and the current owners of the resort want to increase capacity. Despite the presence of people, Wedge-tailed Shearwaters breed on Alphonse and hawksbill and green sea turtles nest here. More than 100 bird species have been recorded and pending permission, we hope to visit nearby Bijoutier and Saint Francois, truely uninhabited paradises for birding, swimming, and snorkeling. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 9 — St. Joseph Atoll, Seychelles</strong><br />\nEarly this morning <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will arrive to anchor at St. Joseph Atoll, some 250 km southwest of Mahé. The remote Indian Ocean atoll is comprised of just over a dozen islands, and St. Joseph Island is the largest with an area of over 400 hectares. Only a few contract workers engaged in harvesting copra and fishing presently live on St. Joseph. </p>\n<p>We plan to spend the morning in the atoll’s lagoon, which is home to a massive population of stingrays and a healthy number of turtles. Giant blue mud crabs migrate from the depths of the lagoon onto the surrounding flats with the high tides. Bonefish abound, as do grouper, lobster and several species of reef fish that will delight swimmers and snorkelers. </p>\n<p>Birders will look skyward to find frigatebirds, while Blue Herons, Crested Terns, Whimbrels and plovers before returning to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> for the balance of the afternoon.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 10 — Praslin and La Digue, Seychelles</strong><br />\n<em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor off Praslin Island, the site of the fabulous Vallée de Mai, one of the Seychelles’ two UNESCO World Heritage Sites. We disembark via Zodiac to the picturesque Baie Ste Anne jetty, and then drive up the scenic coastal road through a quaint fishing village and dense forest of contrasting shades of green to Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve. Praslin has substantial tracts of tropical forests with over 6,000 Coco-de-Mer palms with enormous fan-shaped fronds. These trees can grow more than 100 feet tall, living 800-1,000 years and are home to endemic birds, such as the Seychelles Bulbul and the Seychelles Black Parrot. </p>\n<p>During our walking tour, you will discover this mystical World Heritage Site and capture the cathedral-like feeling of the primeval forest. Listen for the high pitched whistles of the rare Black Parrot as you walk. Later, we depart Vallee de Mai for Cote d’Or Beach, where we have time for a swim or stroll along this beautiful beach. Enjoy refreshments ashore before heading back to the <em>Silver Discoverer</em>. </p>\n<p>In the afternoon, we visit La Digue and probably the best-known island of the Seychelles since its rock formations are so spectacular. The huge granite boulders scattered along the shore resemble modern art sculptures and have been featured in many books and on many postcards. Apart from its brilliant white beaches and strangely shaped rocks, the island has a nature reserve and colonial houses — all making for excellent photography. Take a step back in time and visit L’Union Estate to see a traditional copra mill and watch the antics of the estate’s population of giant land tortoises. Perhaps take time to stroll around the majestic Plantation House framed by giant granite boulders in landscaped gardens. The estate is classified as a National Monument and is also home to one of the most pristine beaches in Seychelles — the legendary ‘Source d’Argent’ — among the most photographed beaches on earth.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 11 — Aride and Curieuse, Seychelles</strong><br />\nAride is the northernmost island of the granitic Seychelles. The island hosts one of the most important seabird populations in the Indian Ocean with more breeding species than any other island in the Seychelles. Eighteen species of native birds breed on Aride including the world's largest colonies of Lesser Noddy and Tropical Shearwater, the world’s only hilltop colony of Sooty Terns and the western Indian Ocean’s largest colony of Roseate Tern. The island has the only breeding colony of Red-tailed Tropicbird east of Aldabra and huge numbers of Brown Noddy, White Tern and Wedge-tailed Shearwater. Thousands of Great Frigatebirds and Lesser Frigatebirds soar over the northern cliffs. </p>\n<p>During lunch <em>Silver Discoverer</em> repositions to Curieuse Island with its checkered and tragic history. Curieuse was a leper colony until 1965 and the doctor’s residence, which dates from the 1870s, is a museum and educational center today.

        "voyage_highlights": "<strong>Day 1 – Port Louis, Mauritius</strong><br />\n  Embark the <em>Silver Discoverer</em> for this inspiring Silversea Expedition entitled, “Indian Ocean Expedition: From Rainforests to Reefs.” After getting settled in, join your Expedition Team to participate in a mandatory safety drill, followed by sail away cocktails out on deck.&nbsp; This evening, become better acquainted with the ship and enjoy the first of many fabulous dining experiences in The Restaurant. \n<p><strong>Days 2-3 – Expedition in Cargados Bank, Mauritius&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nThe <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will ply the waters of the Cargados Bank in Mauritius for two full days so that we might dedicate our time to exploring the islands, coral reefs and turquoise lagoons here in expeditionary style. Roughly 40 islands pepper the Bank with a total land mass of 1.3 square kilometres.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the coral reef covers approximately 190 square kilometres. A few of the islands support coconut palms, bushes and grass, but the granulated coral sands are the star of the show ashore. In the distant past, the Cargados Bank was one large volcano, likely formed by tectonic plates dragging over the Reunion hotspot.&nbsp; Be prepared to explore the fascinating geology, marine life, and bird species here to your heart’s content over the next two days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Days 4-5 – At Sea</strong><br />\nLife on a Silversea expedition ship is packed with new experiences, explorations, and inspirational moments.&nbsp; A day at sea is no different, but the relaxed pace of sea time is a welcome balance to every voyage’s adventure. As the miles peel away in our churning wake, you may wish to take advantage of the fascinating lecture series offered aboard. Our expedition team is comprised of experts in their fields who bring their subjects to life by sharing images and videos representing a wealth of experience. More entertaining and relevant than most university lectures, the choice of presentations on offer through our sea days will stimulate both thought and conversation aboard the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 – Antisiranana, Madagascar</strong><br />\n  Be out on deck early this morning as the <em>Silver Discoverer</em> enters the attractive Bay of Diego, and one of the largest natural bays in the world. Enjoy the views as we cruise the eight nautical miles towards Antsiranana, known as Diego Suarez until 1975 and still called Diego by many. Diego Suarez is actually named after the two Portuguese explorers who “discovered” Madagascar in 1506. In fact, their names were Diego Diaz and Fernando Suarez. In 1885, the beginning of the French protectorate, the French Navy built a military base here and urban growth followed. In 1942, the Allies launched Operation Ironclad and landed forces at Courrier Bay and Ambararata Bay, just west of Diego Suarez. Hundreds of British soldiers fell in the Battle of Madagascar, and most of them were buried in the special British cemetery in the center of town. </p>\n<p>From ‘Diego’ we travel to Montagne d'Ambre (Amber Mountain). This is an isolated patch of montane forest that rises from the surrounding dry region. The park is famous for its waterfalls, crater lakes, and wildlife, especially chameleons. At Joffreville, we visit the Domaine de Fontenay, and its 300 hectares of parkland. This former colonial villa with its century-old manor house is the perfect place to relax after a visit to Amber Mountain National Park. We will enjoy leisurely natural history walks in the private nature reserve, home to five species of lemur, leaf-tailed geckos and ring-tailed mongoose as well as 15 different waterfalls.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Ambohitralanana, Madagascar</strong><br />\n  Today, in true expedition mode, we explore the easternmost part of Madagascar. As part of our exploration we might visit the national park, landing our Zodiacs on the unspoilt beaches, or perhaps visit a local community and learn about the traditional life in this remote part of the island. Our Captain and Expedition Leader will work together to find the best possible experience. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Nosy Mangabe and Mananara, Madagascar</strong><br />\n  Before breakfast, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchored in front of tiny Nosy Mangabe. Part of the larger Masoala National Park complex and formerly a Dutch basis for the slave trade, the island has been protected since 1965. The Nosy Mangabe Special Reserve is a tropical rainforest preserve and our forays ashore today will be primarily to see lemur species in the dense and hilly forests. We hope to spot mouse lemur, gray mouse lemur, Eastern woolly lemur, white-fronted brown lemur, and black-and-white ruffed lemur among others. There are also several fascinating birds such as the Madagascar Buzzard and Paradise Flycatchers to look out for, as well as reptiles and amphibians including leaf-tailed geckos, frogs, small snakes and even an endemic boa.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\nDuring the early afternoon <em>Silver Discoverer </em>will set a course for Mananara where, weather depending, we will land by Zodiac in the late afternoon , to visit this vibrant and small fishing community. After some leisure time exploring the streets and markets, we board pickup trucks to drive out of town towards Aye-Aye Island. To reach the island we will travel across a river in dugout canoes.&nbsp; As the sunsets we will go in search of a nocturnal lemur, known as the Aye-Aye.&nbsp; These tiny, rare lemurs can only be found on Madagascar, and at first glance look nothing like any other lemurs. They possess big eyes, slender fingers, and large, sensitive ears. Aye-Ayes have pointed claws on all their fingers and toes except for their opposable big toes, which enable them to dangle from branches.</p>\n<p>Aye-ayes spend their lives in rain forest trees and avoid coming down to earth. They are nocturnal, and spend the day curled up in a ball-like nest of leaves and branches. The nests appear as closed spheres with single entry holes, situated in the forks of large trees. During our night-time expedition we hope to get memorable glimpses of this unique little animal. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 – Ambodifotatra and Ile aux Nates, Madagascar</strong><br />\nThis morning, we will embark on a walking tour of Ambodifototra, the main town on Ile Ste Marie (Nosy Boraha) a narrow granitic island 57 km long and 8 km wide that is located off the east coast of Madagascar. An atmosphere of peace, tranquillity and pure natural splendour prevails on the island. Lush vegetation and sandy beaches shaded by coconut palms are interspersed by many small villages. Tranquil bays and coves protected by coral reefs all lend themselves to a dreamy feeling that is emphasized by the ‘joie de vivre’ of the Malagasy.</p>\n<p>During lunch, <em>Silver Discoverer </em>will reposition to Ile aux Nates, where we will go ashore on unspoiled tropical beaches with fine white sand, coconut trees scattered along the shore, and a turquoise lagoon protected by coral reefs and inhabited by a variety of exotic marine life. Enjoy swimming and snorkelling in the warm waters, or go in search of the group of black and white lemurs which has been settled here. Perhaps you will be inclined to hunt for one of the rarest orchids worldwide known as the ‘Queen of Madagascar’ (<em>Eulophiella roempleriana</em>), which blooms from November to January. </p>\n<p>A full day of new encounters followed by a delicious dinner aboard <em>Silver Discoverer</em> is perfect way to wrap up our time in Madagascar!</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Day at Sea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\nMost people alive today may never experience the exhilaration of being at sea and out of sight of land. Members of the Expedition Team are ever-vigilant during sea days and spend hours on the bridge and out on deck with binoculars and cameras in hand. They watch for seabirds, marine mammals, schools of feeding fish, and any other unexpected wildlife interactions to share with our guests on the outer decks at a moment’s notice. Take advantage of the fresh air and boundless vistas and spend time today with Silversea Expedition’s experts in search of breaching whales, dolphins or soaring seabirds.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — La Possession, Reunion  (French Overseas Department and European Outermost Region)</strong><br />\nAfter breakfast, we will go alongside in La Possession, on the north western side of La Reunion. Two national parks have been created to protect the Island's nature and UNESCO has given World Heritage status to the \"pitons, cirques and ramparts of Reunion Island.\" For birders the ‘La Roche Ecrite Nature Reserve’ is of prime interest as it was created on the slopes of the 2,276 meter Roche Ecrite to protect the endemic and endangered Reunion Cuckooshrike. </p>\n<p>On a full-day tour we will visit the central highlands where spectacular and rugged volcanic peaks cradle huge amphitheatres known as cirques, and where mountains tower to over 10,000 feet as cascading waterfalls plummet hundreds of feet. On our excursion we will visit the active volcano \"La Fournaise.\" One road, followed by a good track, leads up to Bellecombe Pass situated over the caldera’s cliffs and offers a good point of view over the northeast part of the caldera. From there a stairway path descends from the pass to the caldera floor. A number of footpaths ascending the lava shield inside the caldera are marked, but access depends on the volcanic activity.</p>\n<p>This afternoon, enjoy a typical creole lunch ashore before exploring further with some time for independent exploration in St. Denis, a charming town with a wonderfully French atmosphere.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 – Port Louis, Mauritius</strong><br />\n  Embark the <em>Silver Discoverer</em> for this inspiring Silversea Expedition entitled, “Exploring the Infinite Indian Ocean.” After settling in, join your Expedition Team to participate in a mandatory safety drill, followed by sail away cocktails out on deck.  This evening, become well acquainted with the ship and enjoy the first of many fabulous dining experiences in The Restaurant. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Days 2-3 – Expedition Cargados Bank, Mauritius</strong><br />\nThe <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will ply the waters of the Cargados Bank in Mauritius for two full days so that we might dedicate our time to exploring the islands, coral reefs and turquoise lagoons here in true expeditionary style. </p>\n<p>Roughly 40 islands pepper the Bank with a total land mass of 1.3 square kilometres.  Meanwhile, the coral reef covers approximately 190 square kilometres. A few of the islands support coconut palms, bushes and grass, but the granulated coral sands are the star of the show. In the distant past, the Cargados Bank was one large volcano, likely formed by tectonic plates dragging over the Reunion hotspot.  Be prepared to explore the fascinating geology, marine life, and bird species here to your heart’s content over the next two days. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 4-5 – At Sea</strong><br />\n  Life on a Silversea expedition ship is packed with new experiences, explorations, and inspirational moments.  A day at sea is no different, but the relaxed pace of sea time is a welcome balance to every voyage’s adventure. As the miles to Madagascar peel away in our churning wake, you may wish to take advantage of the fascinating lecture series offered aboard. Our expedition team is comprised of experts in their fields who bring their subjects to life by sharing images and videos representing a wealth of experience. More entertaining and relevant than most university lectures, the choice of presentations on offer through our sea days will stimulate both thought and conversation aboard the ship. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 6 – Antisiranana, Madagascar</strong><br />\nBe out on deck early this morning as the <em>Silver Discoverer</em> enters the attractive Bay of Diego, and one of the largest natural bays in the world. Enjoy the views as we cruise the eight nautical miles towards Antsiranana, known as Diego Suarez until 1975 and still called Diego by many. Diego Suarez is actually named after the two Portuguese explorers who “discovered” Madagascar in 1506. In fact, their names were Diego Diaz and Fernando Suarez. In 1885, the beginning of the French protectorate, the French Navy built a military base here and urban growth followed. In 1942, the Allies launched Operation Ironclad and landed forces at Courrier Bay and Ambararata Bay, just west of Diego Suarez. Hundreds of British soldiers fell in the Battle of Madagascar, and most of them were buried in the special British cemetery in the center of town. </p>\n<p>From ‘Diego’ we travel to Montagne d'Ambre (Amber Mountain). This is an isolated patch of montane forest that rises from the surrounding dry region. The park is famous for its waterfalls, crater lakes, and wildlife, especially chameleons. At Joffreville, we visit the Domaine de Fontenay, and its 300 hectares of parkland. This former colonial villa with its century-old manor house is the perfect place to relax after a visit to Amber Mountain National Park. We will enjoy leisurely natural history walks in the private nature reserve, home to five species of lemur, leaf-tailed geckos and ring-tailed mongoose as well as 15 different waterfalls. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 7 — Nosy Be and Ampangorinana, Nosy Komba, Madagascar</strong><br />\nLocal authorities will clear the ship into Madagascar on the small island of Nosy Be. Once granted clearance to enter the country, we will head out to Lokobe Strict Reserve, located on the southern side of Nosy Be. The reserve’s humid evergreen forests are the habitat of endangered black lemurs that only occur in this part of Madagascar. The lemurs are real beauties and while the males are black as the name suggests, the females can be told apart by their rich reddish brown coloration. In addition to black lemurs, other nocturnal lemur species live here such as the gray-backed sportive and mouse lemurs.</p>\n<p>The Lokobe Strict Reserve is home to endemic birds including the Madagascar Pygmy Kingfisher and the Madagascar Long-eared Owl. Spectacular panther-chameleons, local endemic frogs and several snakes also reside here. After hiking in the western part of the reserve, we will pay a visit to one of the ylang-ylang distilleries. The fragrant flowers are a basic ingredient for expensive perfumes and are steam-processed to extract the oil. There are so many pleasant fragrances enveloping the island, including ylang-ylang, cocoa, vanilla, coffee, coconut, and cinnamon, that Nosy Be’s potpourri of nature's scents will give yet another dimension to our visit.</p>\n<p>During lunch, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will reposition to Ampangorina on Nosy Komba’s north coast. </p>\n<p>Nosy Komba is a small, attractive volcanic island between Nosy Be and the mainland of Madagascar. The island is covered by a magnificent primal forest and has easily accessible, clean and private beaches that offer great swimming and snorkelling. The dense tropical forest, surrounded by clear waters, is home to a multitude of animals from lemurs and makis macacos, to chameleons, lizards, snakes, spiders, and 19 species of birds. Sea turtles, rays, and dolphins frequent the waters around Nosy Komba.</p>\n<p>From Nosy Komba, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> sets a course to the northwest to reach Assumption Island.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 8 — Assumption, Seychelles</strong><br />\n  The <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will pass a morning at sea as she crosses a wide stretch of the Indian Ocean bound for Assumption Island. At the small, crescent shaped island (just over 11 square kilometres in size) we will clear into the Seychelles. After this brief technical stop, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will continue on her path towards Aldabra. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 9-10 – Aldabra, Seychelles </strong><br />\n  Expedition Days<br />\nAldabra is reputedly the world’s second-largest atoll. For two days <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor off Aldabra for the opportunity to visit this remote part of the Seychelles’ Outer Islands. Aldabra has been described as one of nature’s treasures and it will truly be a privilege to visit this UNESCO World Heritage Site. Due to its extreme isolation, Aldabra is virtually untouched by humans and its distinctive island fauna includes the Aldabra giant tortoise. About two thirds of the world population of giant tortoises live on Aldabra. As Aldabra lacks freshwater and is difficult to access, the island has not been developed for tourism. Only a handful of smaller ships with special permits are allowed to call at this unique atoll.</p>\n<p>We hope to enjoy exhilarating drift snorkels as the incoming tide whisks us into a lagoon populated with eagle rays, turtles, and coral gardens teeming with marine life. Time and tides permitting, we may cruise via Zodiac through narrow channels between fossilized coral islands, and between mangrove-covered islands to observe large colonies of nesting boobies and Great Frigatebirds soaring overhead. As the tides pump water in and out of the lagoon, massive numbers of fish come and go through channels to feed. We can snorkel in these same channels, allowing the current to carry us along in the magical scene. Conditions permitting, we will go ashore to visit the small research station on Picard Island and photograph the mighty tortoises living on this isolated spit of land.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 11 — Day at Sea </strong><br />\nWhile expedition travel with Silversea Expeditions is primarily about the excitement and the delight to be found in exploring remote and infrequently visited corners of the world, it remains that you travel with a company renowned for its attention to detail and offering some of the most exemplary service available at sea today.  Perhaps a sea day is your opportunity to enjoy a late breakfast served in the privacy and comfort of your suite. Later, you may choose to join new friends to savor a sunset cocktail on the aft deck as the sun slips below the horizon. Sea days also present a perfect opportunity to enjoy a workout in the gym, indulge in a massage, or visit the salon. In essence, time at sea is time to get spoiled with the service that only Silversea can offer.</p>\n<p>Be sure to take time out today to attend the screening of the voyage’s video recap that our Videographer has been hard at work to create for you. It will feature the highlights of this epic voyage through the seemingly infinite Indian Ocean.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 12 – Zanzibar, Tanzania</strong><br />\nFollowing breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Please Note: Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 – Zanzibar, Tanzania</strong><br />\n  Embark the Silver Discoverer for this inspiring Silversea Expedition entitled, “The Realms of Mozambique and Madagascar.” After getting settled in, join your Expedition Team to participate in a mandatory safety drill, followed by sail away cocktails out on deck.  This evening, become well acquainted with the ship and enjoy the first of many fabulous dining experiences in The Restaurant. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 2 – Kilwa Kisiwani, Tanzania</strong><br />\nThis morning we visit a UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Kilwa Ruins. Our Zodiacs will take us ashore from the ship at anchor, to explore the ruins of Kilwa Kisiwani on foot. Divided into small groups we will look at the haunting ruins of Malindi Mosque and cemetery, Fort Gereza, the tombs of the sultans, several mosques, and the Great House. Highlights include a fourteenth century palace – no other structure of its size was built anywhere along the coast – and a fortified enclosure, very similar to structures found in Syria, Turkey and the Persian Gulf.</p>\n<p>With new knowledge gained of this ancient site, we will head back to Silver Discoverer to enjoy lunch aboard and an afternoon at sea to begin the voyage’s lecture series. Our expedition team is comprised of experts in their fields who bring their subjects to life with the passion of their words and by sharing images and videos representing a wealth of experience.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 3 – Ibo Island, Mozambique</strong><br />\nSilver Discoverer is at anchor this morning off Ibo Island, situated in the Quirimbas Archipelago. With an entire day here to explore, we hope to witness one of the largest mangrove forests in Africa, firmly rooted in front of Ibo Island and some of the fascinating culture aspects of the island. </p>\n<p>Following breakfast, we will shuttle to the shore via Zodiac to meet up with local guides who walk us through streets that feel lost in time and were indeed almost forgotten to the outside world for nearly a century. Ibo Island is one of the most ancient settlements in Mozambique with a history dating back to early 600AD Arab merchant days. Forts once serving as military bastions and slave trading houses, line the shores. Some of the grand, majestic structures have been lovingly restored to former glory, while others have fallen into crumbling, marvellous ruins. Ibo is a melting pot of influences from around the world, creating a culture that is completely unique. </p>\n<p>This evening we will be back aboard, while the ship hauls up anchor for our next stop, to enjoy a Recap and Briefing from the Expedition Team followed by another exquisitely creative dinner aboard.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 4 – Island of Mozambique, Mozambique</strong><br />\nMozambique Island was named after a sultan in the times of the early Portuguese voyages of exploration. The island is small at only 3 km long and some 200 to 500 metres in width. The oldest European building of the southern hemisphere is found on Mozambique Island; the Chapel of Nossa Senhora de Baluarte. As a result of its rich history and architectural remains, the Island of Mozambique is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\n<p>Going ashore using our Zodiacs we will be enthralled by the historical buildings and the fascinating history of the island. Guided in small groups, our walking tours will immerse us into the fascinating mix of African, Arab and European culture and history that is displayed in the churches and mosques, beautiful colonial buildings with thick walls and small traditional houses. Highlights also include, the imposing fort, the old Portuguese houses (some dating back to the sixteenth century), the well-maintained, interesting museums and above all in the local population, and their incredibly varied cultural heritage. </p>\n<p>Before heading back to the ship for the day, you will surely agree there is a colorful and vibrant feel to the island with all the hustle and bustle; yet the charm, sophistication and culture of days-gone-by still lingers.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 5 – Day at Sea</strong><br />\n  Life on a Silversea Expedition ship is packed with new experiences, explorations, and inspirational moments.  A day at sea is no different, but the relaxed pace of sea time is a welcome balance to every voyage’s adventure. As the miles to Madagascar peel away in our churning wake, you may choose to take advantage of the fascinating lecture series offered aboard. Our expedition team is comprised of experts in their fields who bring their subjects to life with the passion of their words and by sharing images and videos representing a wealth of experience. More entertaining and relevant than most university lectures, the choice of presentations on offer through the day will stimulate both thought and conversation aboard the ship. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 6 – Mahajanga, Madagascar</strong><br />\nAfter navigating by Zodiac into the small port of Mahajanga we travel 110 kilometres (68 miles) to one of the largest and last remaining sections of dense dry deciduous forest in Madagascar in the Ampijoroa National Park. The last refuge of several lemur and bird species, the park is filled with critically endangered and endemic species. Home to eight lemur species, the Park is also one of Madagascar's finest birdwatching venues with 129 species. Roughly 75 of the birds are endemic and found nowhere else, including as the Banded Kestrel, Rufous Vanga, Van Dam´s Vanga and Madagascar Fish Eagle. Up to ten frog and 45 reptile species are also found here, like Oustalett's, dwarf, horned and rhinoceros chameleons. </p>\n<p>Guided by the on board Expedition Team and local experts, we will enjoy interpretive walks throughout the forest, as well as a simple lunch within the park.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 7 — Day at Sea</strong><br />\nThe expedition team members are ever-vigilant during sea days and spend hours on the bridge and out on deck with binoculars and cameras in hand. They watch for seabirds, marine mammals, schools of feeding fish, and any other unexpected wildlife interactions to share with our guests on the outer decks at a moment’s notice. Take advantage of the fresh air and boundless vistas and spend time with Silversea’s expert expedition team in search of breaching whales, dolphins or soaring seabirds. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Morondava, Madagascar</strong><br />\nApproximately 50 km northeast of the town of Morondava, lies Kirindy Reserve, a private forest managed by a Swiss company dedicated to a selective and sustainable logging (Centre de Formation Professionelle Forestière). The Reserve is comprised of one of the most outstanding and threatened wildlife habitats in Madagascar known as the ‘dry deciduous forest.’ This habitat type has been reduced to roughly 3% of its original extent, making it highly prized and worthy of protection.</p>\n<p>Kirindy is known to be the best place on the whole island to observe the fossa (a carnivorous mammal that is endemic to Madagascar). Sightings can be especially favourable during the cat-like animals’ mating season between October and December. We hope to have some good views of this elusive predator during our morning walks. </p>\n<p>After a lunch ashore, we will visit the Avenue of the Baobabs, surely one of Madagascar’s highlights. It is likely one of the most accessible places to see the Baobab trees in Africa, and is said to be the most beautiful road in Madagascar. The experience of passing along this road is impressive as a row of imposing Baobab trees stretches along the roadside for close to one-third of a kilometer. The avenue has been a centre of local conservation efforts and was granted protected status, which is the first step toward making it Madagascar's first natural monument.</p>\n<p>Evening will find us back aboard the Silver Discoverer to carry on to our next port of call in Madagascar.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 9 – Belo sur Mer, Madagascar</strong><br />\nA first for any expedition company, today we visit Belo sur Mer. This pleasant Vezo fishing village is located about 80 km south of Morondava. The Vezo are a semi-nomadic people who call southern Madagascar their home. Visitors who come here are greeted by a wonderful kilometer-long stretch of bright white sandy beach and amazing transparent, emerald waters. Enjoy the laidback atmosphere, the stunning red sunsets and the locals who keep the authenticity of their ancestral way of life intact. </p>\n<p>We hope to see the launch of some of the fishing pirogues and large wooden boats that are built here. If we are lucky enough to see the initial launch of one of these boats, it promises to be a brilliant festival. The oversized canoes are propelled by paddles and some also deploy a rectangular sail to take advantage of any passing breeze. The Sakalava people are avid anglers who use outrigger canoes of the same design as those used by proto-Malagasy when they made their voyages across the Indian Ocean.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 10 — Andavadoaka and Nosy Hao, Madagascar </strong><br />\nAnother first on this voyage will be our visit to the small fishing community of Andavadoaka. The village lies on the edge of a shallow lagoon protected from the open ocean by a series of fringing and submerged barrier reefs that support substantial coral growth. The reef provides a vital resource for a local artisanal fishery. Owing to the remote setting and geographic isolation, these coral reefs are thought to possess a significantly higher abundance and diversity of species than other reefs in southwest Madagascar. Andavadoaka is also home to the Vezo fishing people, who are known for their dependence upon the ocean. </p>\n<p>This morning we hope to learn more about community projects that assist and promote the sustainable management of marine resources. Biodiversity studies have identified many hundreds of marine species in the waters in the area. The reefs around Andavadoaka represent some of the most well-developed coral reef systems in the Indian Ocean.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, we plan to visit tiny Nosy Hao for a leisurely afternoon of swimming, snorkelling and relaxing on sandy white beaches. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Days 11-12 — Tulear, Madagascar </strong><br />\nFrom Tulear we will drive 226 kilometres (140 miles) to the Isalo National Park in the Ihorombe Region of Madagascar.  Exquisitely gorgeous, the park is known for its wide variety of terrains, including sandstone formations, deep canyons, palm-lined oases, and grassland. En route to Isalo we will visit the Zombitse National Park where we can see more baobab trees and perhaps the White Shifaka Lemur. </p>\n<p>The scenic road will slowly climb roughly 800 meters (2600 feet) and we will pass through different types of vegetation before arriving at the park and our hotels for the night. Both Hotel Relais de la Reine and Hotel Jardin du Roy have been reserved for our exclusive use as our base for the one night and two days we will spend exploring the area. </p>\n<p>After lunch, we will explore Isalo National Park enjoying various hikes and a special sunset cocktail. <br />\n  Dinner will be served at our overnight accommodations at the Hotel Relais de la Reine and Hotel Jardin du Roy. </p>\n<p>On the morning of ‘Day 12’ of our explorations, we plan to investigate even more of Isalo National Park by undertaking a variety of natural history walks. After a late checkout (with perhaps another chance to shower), enjoy lunch at the hotel before driving back to Tulear. From the port, we will once again board the Silver Discoverer in the evening and say farewell to the beautiful island of Madagascar. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Days 13-14 – At Sea</strong><br />\n  While expedition travel with Silversea Expeditions is primarily about the excitement and delight to be found in exploring remote and infrequently visited corners of the world, it remains that you travel with a company renowned for its attention to detail and offering some of the most exemplary service available at sea today.  Perhaps a sea day is your opportunity to enjoy a late breakfast served in the privacy and comfort of your suite. Later, you may choose to join new friends for a sunset cocktail on the aft deck as the sun slips below the horizon. Sea days also present a perfect opportunity to enjoy a workout in the gym, indulge in a massage, or visit the salon. In essence, time at sea is time to get spoiled with the service that only Silversea can offer.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 15 — Maputo, Mozambique </strong><br />\nArriving on the African continent this morning we clear back into Mozambique in Maputo, the capital of the country hub of East African culture. During our half-day tours we will explore this vibrant city and its rich history. A highlight of the day will certainly be a visit to Fundacao Fernando Leite Couto for a talk with a famous Mozambican artist in a relaxed environment with a chance to enjoy the Mozambican cultural talent or browse through the library. Before returning to the Silver Discoverer we will also visit the Museum of Natural History as well as the vibrant FEIMA curio market.</p>\n<p>Enjoy some time on deck as the Silver Discoverer departs during lunch time and sets course for our final country of this expedition – South Africa. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 16 — Richards Bay, South Africa </strong><br />\nDepart from the quayside in Richard's Bay and journey to an authentic Zulu cultural village located around the St Lucia Wetlands. On arrival at Khula Village we will be met at a traditional Zulu \"Kraal\" (Central meeting place) to begin a journey that weaves an enthralling lesson in Zulu culture and tradition. Gain insight into the life of a Zulu as you are taken through customs and rites of passage, from the charm of the Zulu love letter, to the solemnity of gender roles. Marriage rites, courting rituals, lobola (bartering for the bride’s hand in marriage), the family structure and Zulu spirituality make for a fascinating introduction to these people. </p>\n<p>The mysticism of the Sangoma (witch doctor) is unveiled with a visit to her \"hut\" where an introduction to her herbal and magical medicine takes place. A tour of the surrounding area also portrays modern Zulu life, as several of the local people will open their homes to us. It is here that they will show off their beautiful beadwork, various crafts and the looms that produce the much sought-after mats that often form the basis of their livelihood. </p>\n<p>The day ends on a high note, literally, when guests are privileged to see the rare Umakweyane and other musical instruments played by traditional musicians. With the African bushveld as a stage, Zulu dancers will delight the audience, their bodies pulsating to drums with a characteristic energy. Following this performance, you will have the chance to taste traditional Zulu beer and some time for independent exploration of the village and the handicrafts stalls.</p>\n<p>Board the coach to continue your journey to Hluhluwe Game Reserve. Enjoy a scrumptious light snack on arrival followed by an open vehicle game drive in the Hluhluwe Reserve. Hluhluwe-Imfolozi is the oldest game reserve in all of Africa. Set in the heart of KwaZulu-Natal, the park offers an array of waterholes that are dotted all over the camp for guaranteed wildlife spotting at close range. The park extends itself over 96,000 ha, has an immense variety of flora and fauna and is hugely popular not only for its \"Big Five,\" but for the vast bird life with more than 300 species documented within the reserve.</p>\n<p>Following the game drive we will transfer back to the quayside in Richards Bay, and once again join our little expedition ship for one last evening aboard.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 17 — Durban, South Africa </strong><br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark Silver Discoverer.<br />\n</p>\n<p>Please Note: Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice conditions.

After a mandatory safety drill, head out to the Pool Deck for a ‘Sail  Away’ party, leaving Durban behind. During the afternoon, the Expedition Team  and important crew members will be introduced.<br />\n  In the evening,  enjoy the first of many fine dining experiences in The Restaurant and relax in  one of the lounges or on the open deck.</p>\n<p><b>Day 2 — Richards  Bay, South Africa</b> <br />\n  Depart  from the quayside in Richards Bay and journey to an authentic Zulu cultural  village located around the St Lucia Wetlands. On arrival at Khula Village we  will be met at a traditional Zulu \"Kraal\" (Central meeting place).  There you will gain insight into the life of a Zulu as you are taken through  customs and rites of passage, to the solemnity of gender roles, marriage rites,  courting rituals, <em>lobola</em> (the bartering  for the bride’s hand in marriage), the family structure and Zulu spirituality. <br />\n  A <em>Sangoma</em> (witch doctor) will introduce us  to her herbal and magical medicine, while a tour of the surrounding area also  portrays modern Zulu life, as several of the local people will open their homes  to us showing off their beautiful beadwork, various crafts and the looms that  produce the much sought-after mats that often form the basis of their  livelihood. <br />\n  The <em>Umakweyane</em> and other musical  instruments will be played by traditional musicians. With the African bushveld  as a stage, Zulu dancers will appear, their bodies pulsating to drums.  Following this performance, you will have the chance to taste traditional Zulu  beer and have some time for independent exploration of the village and the  handicrafts stalls.</p>\n<p>We  continue our journey to Hluhluwe Game Reserve. A scrumptious light snack on  arrival will be followed by an open vehicle game drive in the Hluhluwe Reserve.  Hluhluwe-Imfolozi is the oldest game reserve in all of Africa. Set in the heart  of KwaZulu-Natal, the park offers an array of waterholes that guarantee  wildlife spotting at close range. The park extends itself over 96,000 ha, has an  immense variety of flora and fauna, more than 300 bird species recorded and is  not only interesting for its \"Big Five”, but has the largest population of  white rhinos, apart from hundreds of black rhinos.</p>\n<p>Following  the game drive we will transfer back to join <em>Silver Discoverer</em> again. </p>\n<p><b>Day 3 — Inhaca Island, Mozambique</b><br />\n  While <em>Silver Discoverer</em> heads north along the  coast of Southern Mozambique and the Reserva de Maputo our lecture staff will  keep you informed about Mozambique’s special natural history.<br />\n  Around noon, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will have rounded Ilha  dos Portugueses and entered Maputo Bay.<br />\n  Inhaca is an island  that shelters Maputo Bay from the Indian Ocean. A few small villages exit, and  although cultivated fields can be found in the central area it is still partly  covered in subtropical evergreen forest and windswept dunes on the eastern side.  Because of the extensive beaches that attract loggerhead and leatherback  turtles, much of the shore is a nature reserve. <br />\n  <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will anchor on the protected side of Inhaca, south of  Ilha dos Portugueses. Inhaca, Santa Maria and Ilha dos Portugueses all have  beautiful beaches and there are a number of great snorkelling sites. A few  kilometres south of the main settlement Inhaca is the Marine Biology Station  and Museum, run by the Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, Mozambique’s largest and  oldest university.<br />\n  Bottlenose  dolphins and Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins frequent Inhaca’s waters, as well  as some dugong.<br />\n  Our Marine  Biologists will look for the best snorkelling spots, while birders will be  looking for Long-tailed Cormorants, Greater Crested Terns, Black-backed  Puffbacks and Collared Sunbirds.</p>\n<p><b>Day 4 — At Sea </b><br />\n  Our day at sea  will be a good opportunity to attend a seminar, join our experts in the  Discoverer or Explorer Lounge for talks or lectures and learn about the  culinary specialties our Chef might want to present.<br />\n  Other onboard  activities might be a soothing massage or a vigorous workout in the Gym. Our  Bar Team will likely offer exotic cocktails, can prepare special coffees and  will be at hand for Team Trivia at teatime. </p>\n<p><b>Day 5 — Bazaruto  Island, Mozambique </b><br />\n  The  Bazaruto Archipelago is characterized by its wildlife, the azure waters, huge  dunes and unbelievable beaches. The whole archipelago and its surrounding  waters –a total of 1,430 square kilometres- were declared a national park in  1971. It is the only marine park in Mozambique and has been created to protect  the dolphins, turtles and dugongs in its waters. The park can claim to have the  largest concentration of dugong in the Western Indian Ocean. <br />\n  Bazaruto  itself is the largest and most important of the islands. Stunning coral reefs  surround the island, all the more surprising, if one considers the closeness to  mainland Mozambique. Huge sand dunes cover the eastern part, and the southern  coastal plains have numerous small lakes. We will venture ashore for  exploratory walks and will enjoy the beaches. Snorkelers might see stingrays,  devil rays, whitetip and blacktip reef sharks, leatherback, loggerhead and  green sea turtles, apart from the many colourful reef fish found among the  coral. Some of the islands’ lakes have crocodiles and flamingos –exploration  ashore will be quite special.&nbsp; </p>\n<p><b>Day 6 — At Sea </b><br />\n  <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be sailing southward and our lecture  staff will be on hand to enhance some of the things seen in the Bazaruto  Archipelago. Attend informative talks or join our naturalists on the outer  decks looking for cetaceans and seabirds. <br />\n  The  Spa and Gym offer alternative activities, and relaxing on the Pool or Sun Deck  will certainly keep stress away.<br />\n  During  the afternoon, our onboard Photographer/Videographer will present the  Voyage-DVD.</p>\n<p><b>Day 7 — Maputo,  Mozambique </b><br />\n  Following breakfast,  disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences  only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work  together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best  possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice  conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>DAY 1 — CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA</strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Discoverer</em> for your 18-day Silversea Expedition: “Skeleton Coast to Gold Coast”. Once onboard, meet some of your fellow explorers as you become acquainted with the ship’s amenities. Before we set sail a mandatory safety drill will take place. This evening, after settling in and setting sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>DAY 2 — SAldanha, South Africa</strong><br />\n  Saldanha Bay is a small seaside village which has the largest and deepest natural bay in South Africa. There are five islands and abundant sea life in the bay and it is a favourite amongst kite surfers. Today you will have to choose well, as we have three different interesting options for you:</p>\n<p>You can visit the Carmien Rooibos Tea Factory situated in the small town of Citrusdal. The narrow 60 000 hectare belt along the West Coast of South Africa is the only place in the world where Rooibos tea can be grown. This area is also one of the world’s six Plant Kingdoms. The typical Mediterranean climate, ideal temperatures, rainfall and sunshine, the natural terroir needed for Rooibos to be cultivated in harmony with nature are all here. The sandy slopes and undulating valleys of the rugged Cedarberg Mountain Range provide the perfect habitat for Rooibos.</p>\n<p>Carmien Tea has established itself as producer and supplier of quality Rooibos tea products in South Africa. Experience the whole rooibos process from crop to cup. At the factory you will be guided through the Rooibos Tea Pairing with a variety of different flavours and bites. In the community hall you can enjoy gourmet sandwiches, wraps and tacos, pies, samosas and baked goods. Salads and fruit, bakery, dessert and sweet treats will also be available, as well as wine and obviously Rooibos ice tea.&nbsp;All this will be professional done from locally sourced ingredients, highlighting the use of Rooibos Tea in various dishes.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to sample typical dishes, make your way to Langebaan, just 20km from Saldanha Bay. The white sand beaches surrounding the clear waters of the Langebaan Lagoon are one of the main attractions of Langebaan. After a short orientation of Langebaan head over to “Die Strandloper” where gastronomical delights await.</p>\n<p>“Die Strandloper” is an open air seafood restaurant on the beach that offers a ten course traditional West Coast&nbsp;seafood meal, from mussels to crayfish, on open fires for you to feast on! When each course is ready it will be displayed on a serving table and you come and help yourself. The whole extraordinary experience&nbsp;lasts about three hours! After the delicious lunch you will be served coffee which has a unique taste and flavour.</p>\n<p>The third option is a visit to the charming little town Darling where you will meet the Olive Tasting Experience of a lifetime: through many trails and errors, experience has brought Darling Olives to not only producing olives but also their own olive jams, pastes, rubs, chocolate, extra virgin olive oil, flavoured olive oils and even olive soaps. Experience their passion of olives, before embarking on your next journey to “Evita se Perron”.<br />\n  The name was inspired by its location as the former Darling Station. Perron in Afrikaans means ‘station platform’ and Evita refers to the name of South Africa’s most famous white woman: Mrs Evita Bezuidenhout. Here the local comedian and playwright Pieter Dirk Uys (aka ‘Evita Bezuidenhout’) performs his internationally acclaimed shows on stage with Evita or a cast of familiar political characters. <br />\n  On arrival enjoy a traditional lunch before going to explore the art and fascinating presentation at the Perron.<br />\n  Enjoy some free time before departing for Groote Post Wine Estate. The Groote Post Homestead was built in 1808 and the name is derived from its original status as the largest guarding post in the area, set up to protect cattle from marauding stock thieves. In 2001 the Pentz family decided to sell off their prize Holsten herd to concentrate solely on the production of world-class wine. End your day in the lovely green valley on the Kikuyu lawns watched over by the beautifully restored Cape Dutch Klawer Valley Homestead while enjoying a taste of their wonderful wines.</p>\n<p>Return to Saldanha to <em>Silver Discoverer</em>. <strong></strong><br />\n  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>DAY 3 — AT SEA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  Our knowledgeable Lecture Staff members are experts in a variety of scientific fields. Gather in the Explorer Lounge to enjoy the first in a series of informative lectures presented by our onboard Expedition Team. Perhaps learn some tips and techniques for taking better photos during a photographic workshop offered by our resident Photographer. </p>\n<p><strong>DAY 4 — LÜDERITZ, NAMIBIA</strong><br />\n  Leaving the small town of Lüderitz we will visit the abandoned diamond-mining town of Kolmanskop. In 1908, a sparkling diamond was found among the sand and the news spread like wildfire, causing fortune hunters to converge in droves on Kolmanskop. When the town reached its pinnacle Kolmanskop developed into a lively little haven of German culture. However, richer diamond deposits were discovered further south, and operations were moved. Today&nbsp;it is mostly a ghost town; the stately homes, eroded by the wind, are gradually becoming sand-covered. However, a museum has been established and a number of buildings restored. While in Kolmanskop enjoy refreshments before returning to the Silver Discoverer in Lüderitz. <strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>DAYS 5-6 — WALVIS BAY, NAMIBIA</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SCENIC DUNES FLIGHT</strong> <br />\n  Take advantage of an unparalleled opportunity to see the famous Sossusvlei Dunes from the air,&nbsp;a site very difficult to access by land. Following the (normally dry) Kuiseb River, fly over Sesriem Canyon then along the Tsauchab river valley where the freestanding but static dunes tower up to 250 metres above the plain. The dune belt runs north to south for over 70 km between Sossusvlei and the Atlantic. Upon reaching the coast, head north over deserted mining camps and seal colonies to Conception Bay and the wreck of the Eduard Bohlen (run aground in the early 40s). This optional Silver Shore excursion will operate only if weather/fog conditions permit. Please contact Reservations to add this excursion to your booking.<br />\n  For the first afternoon we will depart the pier for the scenic drive along the coastal road to Swakopmund, located 19 miles north of Walvis Bay at the mouth of the Swakop River. En route, you will take in magnificent views of sand dunes on one side, and the Atlantic Ocean on the other. Upon arrival, you will have free time to discover Swakopmund on your own. There are fine examples of German colonial architecture. Founded in 1892 as the main harbour for German South-West Africa, a good part of the population still speaks German today. The Magistrate’s Court, or Kaiserliches Bezirksgericht, the Lutheran Church and the old Railway Station building -now the main reception area of the Swakopmund Hotel- will give an idea of the former splendour. There are quaint restaurants at the waterfront for a scenic coffee break location. Later we head east to the Namib-Naukluft Park. The Namib is one of the oldest deserts in the world, home to the world's highest-shifting sand dunes and adorned with a kaleidoscope of vivid colours. A photo stop will be made at the ‘lunar landscape’ of this vast area of eroded valleys where you can almost imagine you are on the moon. </p>\n<p>Next you will stop off at a special location to enjoy sundowners. A small choir will perform whilst you enjoy the time before the dramatic desert sunset.&nbsp; A selection of dry snacks and finger food will be served. Shortly before sunset we will head back to <em>Silver Discoverer</em> along the coastal road.</p>\n<p>You can begin your second day in Walvis Bay with an early morning boat cruise in the protected outer lagoon area where the water is calm and abundant with bird life. Enjoy wonderful photographic opportunities as playful Heaviside’s and bottlenose dolphins come close the boat and frolic in the boat’s bow wave and wake while pelicans fly low overhead. Atlantic cape fur seals may even come aboard for a fishy snack! Other seabirds we will see include flamingos and cormorants. If we are very lucky, we may even see leatherback turtles, whales, or the local ‘Mola Mola’ or sunfish. We will pass fishing factories and foreign ships in the port and conclude our excursion with a taste of fresh Walvis Bay oysters and local sparkling wine. </p>\n<p>If you would like to explore the desert a little further, depart the quayside and head into the Namib-Naukluft Park. We will first drive to Walvis Bay Lagoon to observe the flamingos (seasonal) and seabirds before heading towards the Kuiseb Delta via the Walvis Bay Saltpans.&nbsp; <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  Sandwich Harbour is a part of the Namib-Naukluft Park that very few have ever visited. Giant sand dunes run straight into the ocean, creating breathtaking sceneries and a unique off-road driving experience in Land Rovers. The Sandwich Harbour Lagoon is a large natural tidal lagoon completely surrounded by large sand dunes, and is only accessible by 4x4 – and even this relies largely on the tides. The lagoon area is fed with fresh water seeping through the sand dunes, and contributes to the beauty and natural diversity of the area. Depending on the tides and the swell, we will try to reach the Sandwich Harbour lagoon along the beach. Alternatively we will take an exciting dune ride to our lookout dune to get an aerial view of the Sandwich Harbour Lagoon where you can feel the isolation Namibia and the Skeleton Coast are so famous for!</p>\n<p>We stop along the way to enjoy drinks &amp; snacks. Depending on wind conditions, this will either be done on top of a high dune overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, on the beach, or amongst the dunes.</p>\n<p>The route homewards will be done tes
ting the power of the vehicles on the dunes, the highlight being the 65 m high roaring dune, giving you exceptional viewpoints on the return to Walvis Bay and the quayside.</p>\n<p><strong>DAY 7 — AT SEA</strong><br />\n  Binoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to watch for seabirds and marine mammals. Attend informative lectures that will prepare you for the upcoming ports-of-call and the adventures that lie ahead. Other onboard diversions include spa treatments, a workout in the Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>DAY 8 — NAMIBE, ANGOLA</strong><br />\n  This afternoon we will head out into the Namibe Desert. Apart from looking for <em>Welwitschia mirabilis</em>, an endemic plant found in the Namibe Provence of South Angola and the Namib Desert, the tour will continue through the desert landscape to The Arch Lagoon, also known as “the lost oasis”. The lagoon, locally known as “Lago do Arco do Carvalhao”, will only have water if Angola has had an excellent rainy season. It is formed by a magnificent rock formation, and is a unique display of art in nature. If it has rained it will be inhabited by an abundance of birdlife. <br />\n  Before returning to the ship, we will visit the little town of Namibe to see the old city with its baroque architecture, old stadium and churches.</p>\n<p><strong>DAY 9 — Ilha dos tigres, ANGOLA</strong><br />\n  Located in front of the Namibe Desert and Iona National Park, Ilha dos Tigres is a unique place. Originally a peninsula belonging to Iona National Park the ocean cut through the narrow isthmus and separated the village of Tigres and the surrounding land from the rest of the coast. Overnight the isolated landmass became Angola’s largest island. Since there was no freshwater the village had to be abandoned. <br />\n  During the morning we want to head ashore via Zodiac to have a look at this little ghost village and see what wildlife is able to survive on the island that still today is sometimes called the Bay of Tigres.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>DAY 10 — LOBITO, ANGOLA</strong><br />\n  Lobito is the main port city situated in western Angola, just north of the Catumbela estuary. Its bay, one of Africa’s finest natural harbours, is protected by a 3-mile long sandpit called Restinga. <strong> </strong><br />\n  We will have a look at Restinga and later visit the Ethnological Museum. From Lobito we will drive to the city of Benguela. Founded in 1617 around Sao Filipe Fortress it was one of the bases for Portuguese expansion in Africa. We will visit the Ethnographic Museum before driving through the city to the most famous church in Benguela. The “Igreja do Populo” was built by the Portuguese during the colonial era, being the first stone building in southern Angola. From there we will walk to the heart of Benguela City, where the courthouse surrounds the company gardens, the Department of Justice and the Town Hall. The gardens are lined with beautiful palm trees and flowers and offer a very picturesque setting. <br />\n  En route back to Lobito we will stop at the city of Catumbela and will stop at Sao Pedro fort for some photos, and will&nbsp;see the big Catumbela River and the 1905 steel bridge, from Eiffel’s engineering company, which was in use until 2010.<br />\n  Once back at the pier there will be a festival with traditional dances and singing. <br />\n  <strong>DAY 11 — AT SEA and luanda, angola</strong><br />\n  Continuing along the coast of Angola, our lecturers will take the opportunity to give lectures and to inform you about the different highlights Luanda has to offer.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will arrive in Angola’s capital and home to more than four million -making it the third-largest Portuguese speaking city in the world. We will take the time to drive along Marginal Bay, with the commercial part of the city on the one side, and views across the bay on the other. Driving past the Angola National Bank, a great example of colonial architecture, we will be passing Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Nazaré and eventually pass the Iron Palace and the Agostinho Neto Mausoleum, a huge stylized obelisk, for a photo stop. <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  We will then visit the San Miguel Fort with its striking blue tiles. Originally built in 1576, its purpose was to defend the port and the city from attack by the marauding French and Dutch. You will have time to walk around and take in the view, before enjoying a special dinner at the Fort. </p>\n<p>We will be heading back to the quayside to re-join the <em>Silver Discoverer </em>after sunset.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong> </strong><br />\n  <strong>DAY 12 — LUANDA, ANGOLA</strong><br />\n  During our second day in Angola we will continue to do more sightseeing. We will take local boats to Mussulo Island, a favourite beach spot for the residents of Luanda. On Mussulo we will have some time to relax on the beach or by the pool. From there we will head back to the mainland by boat and will be visiting Angola’s Slave Museum opposite Mussulo. <br />\n  We will then drive north to Benfica and the market where you can try your bargaining skills for the many wooden artefacts and paintings on offer. <br />\n  Continuing our drive back into Luanda, we will stop at the Nieto Mausoleum for a visit. Close by are Cidade Alta, or “Uptown” —a pleasant, airy and calm suburb with several pink colonial buildings- and Baixa,&nbsp;or “Downtown”, where we can view the Houses of Parliament — both new and old. If the entry is permitted on this day, we will visit the Parliament before returning to the pier and <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.<br />\n  <strong>DAYs 13-14 — AT SEA</strong><br />\n  Leaving the coast of Angola behind, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will head towards Sao Tome and Principe, not only one of the smaller African countries which few have heard of. <br />\n  While <em>Silver Discoverer</em> has to cover almost 700 nautical miles, our lecturers will present interesting topic, seminars and workshops. You can also head out on deck helping our Ornithologist to watch for seabirds and our Marine Biologist looking for marine mammals. Other onboard diversions include the Spa and Gym, plus there are always moments to savour the different culinary specialities prepared by our Executive Chef and his (or her) team. <strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>DAY 15 — sao tome, sao tome and principe</strong><br />\n  The Portuguese-speaking island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe is located in the Gulf of Guinea, and is a virtually undiscovered paradise. Palm fringed beaches, crystal clear water and barely explored jungles are surely the reason for the pervasive national mood. Some of the world’s best coffee is produced on the island, and one of today’s options is a full-day tour is to experience coffee culture at São Tomé's Monte Café plantation and learn how coffee is still processed in the traditional manner. Then, continue the drive up the mountain to the Waterfall of Sâo Nicolâo, to have a cup of coffee. Afterwards, descend the mountain to the Plantation of Agostinho Neto, to see the colonial architecture of this grand estate and to visit the botanical garden. Continue to the beach of Conchas to relax and have a swim before lunch. On the way to the Plantation of Monteforte, where a traditional lunch is waiting, pass by the Blue Lagoon. <br />\n  Another full day option would be to travel along the east coast to enjoy the view of Ilhéu de Santana. In Água Izé we will stop at the viewpoint, Miradouro d'Água Izé and visit the cocoa plantation to meet with a local historian. On our way, we pass by Rio Iô Grande before continuing to Boca do Inferno -a natural blowhole- and for some refreshing coconut water. We will take a break at the beach of Praia de 7 Ondas and might swim before lunch, weather permitting. Before continuing our exploration, we will stop at the plantation house of São João to enjoy a Creole-fusion lunch. After lunch, there will be time to discover the installations of the plantation estate that include an art gallery and installations for treatment of different products from the plantation such as jam and liquors, depending on the season and the harvest.<br />\n  Alternatively for a half day tour, visit the Fortress of Sâo Sebastiâo for an introduction to the colonial history of Sao Tomé and Principe. Drive to the fishermen’s village of Pantufo to taste some smoked fish and hear about the traditional methods of fishing. The Cathedral is an important landmark in the history of Catholicism in Africa, while Independence Square -where independence was celebrated in 1975- would be for Sao Tome. Other sites include the Municipal Market, the most important commercial houses in the city centre and other buildings from colonial time. <br />\n  If snorkelling is your main interest, two small groups can be taken for a half day excursion to the Blue Lagoon for swimming and snorkelling.<br />\n  In the evening we will have a pre-dinner music presentation by a local group onboard <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.<br />\n  <strong>DAY 16 — Bom Bom Island, principe, sao tome and principe</strong><br />\n  Atop the northernmost point of Principe is Bom Bom, a small island that will welcome us this morning. Going ashore by Zodiac we will be greeted by local musicians providing entertainment for the duration of our visit. A 140 metre wooden bridge leads from the small islet to a resort well hidden in the local forest. <strong></strong><br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  Ashore we will have guides for a long, medium and slow walk. Of these the long walk of 7-8 miles will lead into the forest, while the other walks are on the road leading to the next village or will explore the property and its plants.<br />\n  You do not necessarily have to hike -the resort offers two splendid beaches for swimming and snorkelling and we will have rooms available to change into bathing costumes. Birders will be looking for the Principe Sunbird, Principe Speirops, Principe Golden Weaver, Principe Glossy Starling, Principe and Blue-breasted Flycatcher and will certainly notice the semi-habituated Grey Parrot next to the restaurant.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will leave Sao Tome and Principe for our next stop in Togo.</p>\n<p><strong>DAY 17 — At sea</strong><br />\n  Having left Bom Bom Island, this last sea leg will permit you to edit the photos you have taken so far, to attend talks by our experts, to relax at the pool and to enjoy the many culinary highlights prepared by our chefs.<br />\n  In the evening our onboard Videographer will present our voyage-DVD recounting the many different sites and encounters of our West African voyage “From the Skeleton Coast to the Gold Coast”..<strong></strong><br />\n  <strong>DAY 18 — Lome, togo</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will dock early in the morning and we will be greeted by local entertainment before we head out for a full-day tour of Togo’s hinterland.<br />\n  We start our tour driving through the old colonial town with its modern-looking independence square before reaching Ewe village after a good hour. Here we will be welcomed by traditional dancers and the local school children. This will be one of the best opportunities to learn about village life in Togo and to hand over your contribution of school supplies. Fascinating fabrics are on sale and you will be able to see how they are prepared locally.</p>\n<p>Heading further north we will reach Kloto forest at Kpalime and divide into smaller groups to learn about the medicinal and commercial plants found in and near the secondary forest.<br />\n  During and after lunch and souvenirs will be on offer nearby.<br />\n  On our return we will have the unique opportunity to partake in a Voodoo ceremony –or at least to have a look at how these ceremonies take place.</p>\n<p>In the evening a dance performance by the Lome Dance Troup will take place on board <em>Silver Discoverer</em> just before departure</p>\n<p><strong>DAY 19 — TEMA, GHANA</strong><br />\n  This morning, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em> after breakfast.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Please Note:</em></strong><em> Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity. Expedition Team members scheduled for this voyage are subject to change or cancellation.</em></p>\n<p><strong>360 DEGREES OF GIVING</strong> <br />\n  They say it’s better to give than to receive, luckily we have the opportunity to do both. The friendly villagers we visit throughout our expedition welcome us with such warm hearts, and we receive so much from them, that we want to make sure we’re giving right back.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of goodwill, we greatly encourage you to help us support the local communities we will be visiting. Gifts may consist of second-hand children’s clothing, school supplies (pencils, pens, and writing tablets), and medical supplies (Band-Aids, antiseptic wipes, and first aid items). Supplies received will be collected on board by the Expedition Team and evenly distributed throughout the villages as we visit.</p>\n<p><strong>GEAR UP</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not sure what to wear while onboard? <a style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #000; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://www.shiptoshoretraveler.com/silversea\">Visit our shop and gear up</a>.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Expedition Highlights:</b></p><p><br />\n  •\tLook for lemurs and endemic bird species near Tulear and in the Kirindy Forest <br />\n  •\tSee the “Avenue of the Baobabs” <br />\n  •\tVisit Zanzibar’s Stone Town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site<br />\n  •\tBe one of the few to explore Aldabra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site <br />\n  •\tLook for the Indian Ocean’s largest Red-footed Booby colony on Cosmoledo</p>\n<p><b>Day 1 — Maputo, Mozambique</b><br />\n  Embark Silver Discoverer this afternoon and depart on your exciting 17-day Silversea Expedition – Expedition Madagascar and Aldabra. After a mandatory safety drill, the Expedition Team and important crew members will be introduced.<br />\n  Stay out on deck for a ‘Sail Away’ party leaving Maputo behind, before enjoying the first of many fine dining experiences in The Restaurant.</p>\n<p><b>Days 2-3 — At Sea</b><br />\n  Two sea days will be a good start to your voyage, as they will permit you to settle in comfortably, recover from your long journey to Maputo, meet some of your fellow travellers and make full use of our small, manoeuvrable ship while we start covering the western part of the Indian Ocean. <br />\n  Our lecturers will offer talks preparing you for the visit to Madagascar, be it about its historical aspects or natural history. In addition you can unwind, relax, and make use of the gym or Spa, or any of the other amenities Silver Discoverer can offer.</p>\n<p><b>Day 4 — Tulear and Nosy Ve, Madagascar </b><br />\n  As soon as we have cleared into Madagascar at Tulear, we will drive within the northern limit of the Madagascar spiny thickets, an ecoregion with a high percentage of endemic plants, and will visit the Arboretum. Far from the prevailing northeastern rains, this ecoregion shows extreme adaptation to aridity -with the spiny thickets usually between 3 and 6 meters in height. Within this area the coastal mikea forest is quite unique. Apart from Burseraceae, baobabs, euphorbias, and members of the cashew family, several endemic lemurs and birds are found here. Birders will look for Banded Kestrels, Long-tailed Ground-Rollers, Sickle-billed Vanga and Subdesert Mesite, while apart from the endemic white-footed sportive and the grey mouse lemur, the large-eared and lesser hedgehog tenrecs and horned chameleon can be found in this ecoregion. </p>\n<p>After lunch, Silver Discoverer will head over to small Nosy Ve, an island sacred to the Vezo people. It was used by the French in the 19th century, but today is uninhabited except for birds. While Red-tailed Tropicbirds nest here all year round, other birds to look for are Humblot’s Heron, Common and Lesser Crested Terns, Crab Plovers, Common Greenshanks and Souimanga Sunbirds. <br />\n  The afternoon can be spend walking on or around this 0.5 square kilometre island, looking for birds, beachcombing or snorkelling and swimming from the beach.</p>\n<p><b>Day 5 — Andavadoaka and Nosy Hao, Madagascar</b><br />\n  Today we will visit the small fishing community of Andavadoaka. The village lies on the edge of a shallow lagoon protected from the open ocean by a series of fringing and submerged barrier reefs that support substantial coral growth. These coral reefs are thought to possess a significantly higher abundance and diversity of species than other reefs in southwest Madagascar. Andavadoaka is home to the Vezo people. </p>\n<p>This morning we hope to learn more about community projects that assist and promote the sustainable management of marine resources. Biodiversity studies have identified many hundreds of marine species in the waters in the area. The reefs around Andavadoaka represent some of the most well-developed coral reef systems in the Indian Ocean.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, we plan to visit tiny Nosy Hao for a leisurely afternoon of swimming, snorkelling and relaxing on sandy white beaches. </p>\n<p><b>Day 6 — Morondava, Madagascar</b><br />\n  Approximately 50 km northeast of the town of Morondava lies Kirindy Reserve, a private forest managed by a Swiss company dedicated to a selective and sustainable logging. The Reserve has some 12,000 hectares and is comprised of one of the most outstanding and threatened wildlife habitats in Madagascar known as the ‘dry deciduous forest’.<br />\n  Kirindy is known to be the best place on the whole island to observe Madagascar’s largest predator, the endemic fossa. Sightings can be especially favourable during December. We hope to have some good views of this elusive animal during our morning walks. Red-fronted brown lemurs, as well as other species of lemur, are present and seven species of chameleons. For birders quite a number of endemics can be found, including Sakalava Weavers, Madagascar Paradise Flycatcher, Madagascar Bee-eater, Madagascar Hoopoe, and Madagascar Blue Vanga.</p>\n<p>After a lunch ashore, we will visit the Avenue of the Baobabs, surely one of Madagascar’s highlights. It is likely one of the most accessible places to see baobab trees in Africa, and is said to be the most beautiful road in Madagascar. The experience of passing along this road is impressive as a row of imposing baobab trees stretches along the roadside for close to one-third of a kilometre. The avenue has been a centre of local conservation efforts and was granted protected status. </p>\n<p><b>Day 7 — At Sea</b><br />\n  Silver Discoverer will sail in a northwesterly direction across the Mozambique Channel. Our lecturers will recap the special sightings and event in Madagascar and will talk about Mozambique, our next destination.<br />\n  While out on deck, help our Marine Biologist spot southern right whales or humpback whales frequently seen in the channel. Relax on the Sun Deck and enjoy a refreshing drink at The Pool Bar.</p>\n<p><b>Day 8 — Island of Mozambique, Mozambique</b><br />\n  Mozambique Island was named after a sultan in the times of the early Portuguese voyages of exploration. The island is small at only 3 km long and some 200 to 500 metres in width. The oldest European building of the southern hemisphere is found on Mozambique Island; the Chapel of Nossa Senhora de Baluarte. As a result of its rich history and architectural remains, the Island of Mozambique is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<br />\n  <br />\n  Going ashore using our Zodiacs we will be enthralled by the historical buildings and the fascinating history of the island. Guided in small groups, our walking tours will immerse us into the fascinating mix of African, Arab and European culture and history that is displayed in the churches and mosques, beautiful colonial buildings with thick walls and small traditional houses. Highlights also include the imposing fort, the old Portuguese houses (some dating back to the sixteenth century), the well-maintained, interesting museums, and above all the local population and their incredibly varied cultural heritage. </p>\n<p>There is a colorful and vibrant feel to the island with all the hustle and bustle; yet the charm and culture of days gone by still lingers. </p>\n<p><b>Day 9 — Ibo Island</b><br />\n  Silver Discoverer will be at anchor this morning off Ibo Island, situated in the Quirimbas Archipelago. With an entire day here to explore, we hope to explore one of the largest mangrove forests in Africa, firmly rooted in front of Ibo Island, and witness some of the fascinating culture aspects of the island. </p>\n<p>Following breakfast, we will shuttle to shore via Zodiac. After a long ride we will meet up with local guides who walk us through streets that feel lost in time and were indeed almost forgotten to the outside world for nearly a century. Ibo Island is one of the most ancient settlements in Mozambique with a history dating back to early 600AD Arab merchant days. Forts once serving as military bastions and slave trading houses line the shores. Some of the grand, majestic structures have been lovingly restored to former glory, while others have fallen into crumbling ruins. Ibo is a melting pot of influences from around the world, creating a culture that is completely unique.</p>\n<p><b>Day 10 — Kilwa Kisiwani, Tanzania</b><br />\n  A morning at sea will permit to continue the voyage’s lecture series. Our experts will bring their subjects to life with the passion of their words and by sharing images and videos representing a wealth of experience. Tanzania’s two UNESCO World Heritage Sites we intend to visit will certainly feature in one of the presentations.<br />\n  This afternoon, we visit the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Kilwa Ruins. Our Zodiacs will take us ashore to explore the ruins of Kilwa Kisiwani on foot. Divided into small groups we will look at the haunting ruins of Malindi Mosque and cemetery, Fort Gereza, the tombs of the sultans, several mosques, and the Great House. Highlights include a fourteenth century palace – no other structure of its size was built anywhere along the coast – and a fortified enclosure, very similar to structures found in Syria, Turkey and the Persian Gulf.</p>\n<p><b>Day 11 — Zanzibar, Tanzania</b><br />\n  Today we will visit another UNESCO World Heritage Site: Stone Town — a fine example of a Swahili coastal trading town. At the City Market we can see and smell the tropical fruits that are on offer and can see the freshly ground spices. Within walking distance is the Anglican Church, built over the old Great Slave Market. Slaves from all over East Africa had been brought here and had been kept in underground chambers. <br />\n  Our destination will be a spice farm in the countryside. To get there we will drive past the Old Arab Fort and Dr. Livingstone’s house. At the spice farm you will have a guided tour and can taste some of the exotic spices and fruits grown here. The different plants are grown for food flavouring, for cosmetics, as dyes and for traditional medicine. <br />\n  A visit to the Jozani Forest and a nearby mangrove area would give a glimpse of the botany of the central part of the island.<br />\n  Alternatively you might only want to go swimming and snorkelling at a sand bank. To get there you will be taken by traditional dhows. The crystal clear waters invite you to explore the underwater world, looking for coral and fishes. </p>\n<p><b>Day 12 — At Sea</b><br />\n  Today Silver Discoverer has to sail in an east-southeasterly direction to reach Aldabra. Because of its isolation in the Indian Ocean and containing one of the most important natural habitats for studying evolutionary and ecological processes, the raised coral islands of this atoll show remarkable wildlife. Aldabra is not only home to the largest giant tortoise population in the world, but also has interesting marine fauna. Let our naturalists share insights into this unique group of islands that receives a limited amount of visitors and with special permits only per year.</p>\n<p><b>Days 13-14 — Aldabra, Seychelles</b><br />\n  For two days Silver Discoverer will anchor off Aldabra for the opportunity to visit this remote part of the Seychelles’ Outer Islands. Aldabra has been described as one of nature’s treasures and it will truly be a privilege to visit this UNESCO World Heritage Site. Due to its extreme isolation, Aldabra is virtually untouched by humans and its distinctive island fauna includes the Aldabra giant tortoise. About two thirds of the world population of giant tortoises live on Aldabra. As Aldabra lacks freshwater and is difficult to access, the island has not been developed for tourism. Only a handful of smaller ships with special permits are allowed to call at this unique atoll.</p>\n<p>We hope to enjoy a drift snorkel as the incoming tide moves us into a lagoon populated with eagle rays, turtles, and coral gardens teeming with marine life. Time and tides permitting, we may cruise via Zodiac past mangrove-covered islands to observe large colonies of nesting boobies and Great Frigatebirds soaring overhead. As the tides pump water in and out of the lagoon, massive numbers of fish come and go through channels to feed. We can snorkel in these same channels, allowing the current to carry us along in the magical scene. Conditions permitting, we will go ashore to visit the small research station on Picard Island and photograph the mighty tortoises living on this isolated spit of land.</p>\n<p><b>Day 15 — Cosmoledo, Seychelles</b><br />\n  Cosmoledo is an atoll about 85 miles east of Aldabra. The atoll has more than 20 small islands and islets and has been repeatedly used by humans for the harvesting of local resources including guano and fish. Abandoned in 1992, the islands have recovered naturally, assisted by a conservation organization that works to eradicate introduced species. <br />\n  Cosmoledo is an Important Bird Area and we will see the Indian Ocean’s largest colony of Red-footed Boobies, the Seychelles’ largest colony of Sooty Terns, as well as Black-naped Terns, Crested Terns and Red-tailed Tropicbirds. If conditions cooperate, two narrow passes on the southern side will permit Zodiacs to enter the lagoon where several beaches wait to be explored. Here snorkelers should be able to find an interesting underwater world to occupy their time. </p>\n<p><b>Day 16 — At Sea</b><br />\n  Covering the distance of 440 nautical miles to our next destination, Silver Discoverer will sail on a northeasterly course. <br />\n  Apart from the lectures given by our specialists, let the Chef and his team tempt you with special culinary treats. Our Spa Team is there to pamper you, and if you think you need a workout, the Gym is always available. You could also start to edit your photos or simply relax on the outer deck or in the comfort of your suite. </p>\n<p><b>Day 17 — Desroches, Seychelles</b><br />\n  Desroches is one of the Outer Islands and the main island of the Amirante group of the Seychelles. Located 230 km southwest of Mahé, it has a land area of only 3.24 km², but has a staggering 15 kilometers of fine sand beaches. The northern part of the island is a coconut plantation and farm, with a settlement on the far shore. The first coconut plantations were started in 1875 and copra is still processed on the island before being transported to Mahé for export. <br />\n  After spending the morning exploring this beautiful beach, we plan to return to Silver Discoverer for a late lunch.<br />\n  The onboard Photographer/Videographer will present the Voyage-DVD during the afternoon.</p>\n<p><b>Day 18 — Mahé, Seychelles</b><br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark Silver Discoverer. <br />\n</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

After a mandatory safety drill head out onto the Pool Deck for a ‘Sail Away’ party. <br />\n  Later during the afternoon, the Expedition Team and important crew members will be introduced.<br />\n  In the evening enjoy the first of many fine dining experiences in The Restaurant and relax in the Discoverer Lounge or on the open decks.</p>\n<p><b>Day 2 — Uligamu, Maldives</b><br />\n  The Maldives are made up of 1190 islands, of which 200 are inhabited, and during the morning <i>Silver Discoverer </i>will head for Uligamu, one of the northernmost inhabited islands of Haa Alif Atoll and the Maldives. Based on its location the island is visited by many yachts on their way into or out of the Arabian Sea.<br />\n  Our Expedition Staff will start the lecture series during the morning, preparing you for the underwater world we will encounter during the next few days in the Maldives and Lakshadweep Islands. <br />\n  We will disembark after lunch, and while you might want to have a look at the small community of some 300 inhabitants, our Marine Biologist will be looking for the perfect snorkelling spot southwest of the village.<br />\n  The island has been selected as the first in the Maldives to use a combination of renewable energies via wind turbines and solar panels in a micro grid, hoping to help the island through more efficient and non-pollutant energy distribution.<br />\n  South of the village is a nice beach and offshore are some good snorkelling sites where damselfish, rabbitfish, surgeonfish, angelfish, butterfly fish and chromis can easily be seen. Hawksbill turtles and even manta rays were present during earlier visits. </p>\n<p><b>Day 3 — Minicoy, Lakshadweep Islands, India</b><br />\n  Largely unexplored and unknown, both above and below the water, the Lakshadweep Sea is home to 36 little islands, one of the most spectacular tropical island systems. Most of the islands are inhabited only by birds and hermit crabs. The precious heritage of the Lakshadweep’s ecology and culture is supported by an extremely fragile ecosystem. </p>\n<p>The southernmost island of the group in the Lakshadweep, Minicoy, is geographically isolated from other islands. The culture here is a mix of Maldivian and South Indian.  Minicoy is about 10.6 km long and is the second largest island in the Lakshadweep Group and is almost completely covered with coconut palms.</p>\n<p>Not only will Minicoy be our entrance point to India, this visit can be used to explore the island with its many coconut palm trees and nice beaches. The island itself is the southern part of a tear-shaped atoll. In the unspoiled waters of the lagoon, living coral reefs of vibrant blue, green, and yellow ring the island and are home to many colourful reef fish, from lionfish to angelfish to butterfly fish. In the clear blue water, you will see a spectacular display of ocean life, including squid, octopi, sea cucumbers, rays, crabs, and even green or hawksbill turtles. Several shipwrecks in the area initiated construction of a lighthouse in 1885. These wrecks are virtual underwater museums and fish species found here are said to be larger than average normal size found elsewhere.</p>\n<p><b>Day 4 — Suheli Island, Lakshadweep Islands, India</b><br />\n  Today <i>Silver Discoverer</i> will reach another of the rarely visited atolls of the Lakshadweep Islands.  The atoll has three little islands at the northern, eastern and southwestern corner of the reef.<br />\n  Our Marine Biologists will be looking for the perfect snorkelling site and our other experts will be there to help you ashore, conditions permitting. Ashore we hope to offer activities such as walks along the beach, beachcombing, looking for birds or explaining the local botany.</p>\n<p><b>Day 5 — Thinnakara Island, Lakshadweep Islands, India</b><br />\n  North of Suheli are Thinnakara Island and Bangaram Island -both share a vast lagoon and coralline banks. The actual lagoon area amounts to 125 square kms. <br />\n  Thinnakara is a tiny almond shaped island within the magnificent lagoon. The sun-drenched beaches and the swaying palms form a perfect backdrop to the spectacular marine flora and fauna. The shallow lagoon with crystal clear water, the coral reef and blue lagoon invite to spend the morning in the water, swimming or snorkelling, discovering graceful schools of fish in the water, or looking ashore for hermit crabs on the beach and seabirds in the lush coconut groves.</p>\n<p><b>Days 6-7 — Cochin India</b><br />\n  Have a leisurely breakfast and attend a pertinent lecture presentation about one of the many facets of India while we approach the state of Kerala and southern India’s port of Cochin. Because of the location between China and Europe and the spice trade the port and town with the easy access to the sea used to be called “Queen of the Arabian Sea”.</p>\n<p>Around mid-day, we expect to be welcomed with a traditional Kerala shinkari melam, a group of musicians playing traditional instruments.</p>\n<p>We will use the afternoon and the following day to get a better insight into this port and the surrounding area and will drive through one of India’s most beautiful and tranquil landscapes to visit Alleppey, the “City of Canals” or “Venice of the East”, located south of Cochin between the Arabian Sea and Lake Vembanad, India’s longest lake.</p>\n<p>Alleppey’s port was opened to foreign trade by the British in the late 18th century to end the Dutch commercial supremacy in Cochin. Today prawn farming and coconuts form the basis for the city’s economy. We will board a houseboat and cruise the river, lake and canals, collectively known as “the Backwaters”, and have a look at old colonial warehouses and typical thatched local homes. Brilliant green paddy fields where farming is done below sea level, will give way to views of village life and glimpses of churches, mosques and temples.</p>\n<p>While we cruise the “Backwaters”, a typical Keralan snack with tea, south Indian coffee and fruit juices will be served.<br />\n  <br />\n  After the cruise we will reach a special location, beautifully illuminated by hundreds of oil lamps giving it an earthly spiritual feel for an exclusive Mohiniyattam performance that will be done by Keralan women in traditional attire. After this exceptional presentation, you will be treated to a special Syrian Christian dinner, mixing Indian and European influences.</p>\n<p>The following morning we will board local cruise boats to reach Fort Cochin. In Cochin we will walk through the Heritage city to see the wonderful array of architectural styles dating back to the Portuguese, British and Dutch periods, before the East India Company took over in 1814. There are Portuguese churches including the oldest Portuguese church in India going back to the year 1503, a Jewish synagogue, as well as mosques and Hindu temples. During the walk we visit the Indo-Portuguese Museum and finally the David Hall Gallery. Here a prominent historian will talk about the history of Cochin and the spice trade, followed by a Kalaripayattu (martial arts) performance.</p>\n<p>Following the performance you will be treated to a special Mopilah lunch catered by celebrity chef Mrs. Faiza Moosa. The Mopilah are Muslims from the Malabar region and known for their food. While we are there, Mrs. Moosa will present autographed copies of her cookbooks.</p>\n<p>From the gallery you will take local Tuk-Tuks (open 2-seater taxis) to reach the Mattancherry Palace built by the Raja of Kochi. We will visit the Palace, walk to the Jewish Synagogue and Dutch Palace and will have some spare time to wander around Jew Town, looking at souvenir and antique shops before being taken back to Silver Discoverer by local boats. </p>\n<p><b>Day 8 — Beypore, India</b><br />\n  Beypore is located in Kozhikode at the mouth of the Chaliyar River. Formerly known as Calicut it was an important centre for Malabar trade in spices and textiles. The shipbuilding yard at Beypore port is famous for its traditional construction of the ‘Uru’ or the Arabian trading vessel. This tradition of shipbuilding is nearly 1,500 years old, and the craftsmanship of the workers here is exceptional.</p>\n<p>We will either witness wooden Dhows being built or will proceed to Feroke Tile factory. Feroke is the cradle of the tile industry in Kerala. Then we proceed by coach to the nearby weaving Centre Tasara, a creative and experimental weaving centre where hand weaving and all related textile activities including, dyeing, batik, tie and dye, block and screen printing are taught.<br />\n  We will continue to Calicut, to a venue for our exclusive use and refreshments followed by a Kalaripayattu performance – the training in the traditional style of combat. The rituals include the worship of certain Hindu gods inside the Kalari, the arena. After the Kalaripayattu performance, treat yourself to another sumptuous Mopilah lunch. <br />\n  After the lunch, you will be driven to the busiest street in Kozhikode to try a variety of local halwa (sweet meats). Today the street bustles with shops that sell anything and everything including locally famous sweets and banana chips. </p>\n<p><b>Day 9 — At Sea<br /></b>\n  <i>Silver Discoverer</i> will sail on a northerly course, giving you time to attend a seminar or talk, relax on the outer decks, make use of The Gym or let yourself be pampered in The Spa. <br />\n  Our experts will want to share information regarding our upcoming port and its Portuguese heritage. Even the name of the largest city in Goa reflects the early European history, honouring Portugal’s most famous explorer Vasco da Gama.</p>\n<p><b>Day 10 — Mormugao (Goa), India</b><br />\n  Today we will drive from Mormugao, Goa’s most important harbour, to Velho Goa (“old Goa” in Portuguese) to be able to see the Bom Jesu Basilica and the churches and convent of old Goa which have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Quite close to the Bom Jesu Basilica is the gigantic Se Cathedral built in Portuguese-Gothic style. Its bell –known as the “Golden Bell” for its sound- is said to be one of Goa’s largest. <br />\n  You could also visit one of Goa’s famous spice farms to see, smell and taste some of the local spices and to find out how black pepper, cardamom, nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, chilies, and coriander look like before consumption or see the landscape and fluvial system from sea level in a kayak. </p>\n<p><b>Day 11 — Murad-Janjira, India</b><br />\n  During the late morning, <i>Silver Discoverer </i>will arrive at Murud-Janjira, one of the most unusual old fortifications along India’s coast. This island fortification set on an oval rock just offshore from Rajapuri defended the entrance to Rajapuri Creek. Built in the 17th century and apparently never defeated, it is said to have housed more than 570 cannons at one stage including some of India’s biggest cannons.<br />\n  We will go ashore to explore the interior of this marine fort, looking at the bastions, cannons, the two freshwater ponds, and the remains of the officers’ quarters, the mosque and the palace. </p>\n<p><b>Day 12 — Mumbai, India</b><br />\n  Quite early,<i> Silver Discoverer </i>will go alongside in Mumbai. <br />\n  There will be several interesting choices for you: see ancient sites relating to Buddhist worship in the Kanheri Caves located in the Sanjay Gandhi National Park or the network of the sculpted Elephanta Caves (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) on Elephanta Island, a cave temple complex dedicated to Shiva with magnificent sculptures, including the 7-metre-high masterpiece of Shiva, representing the three aspects of Shiva as Creator, Preserver and Destroyer.<br />\n  You can also look behind the façade of Mumbai’s daily life by visiting the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly the Victoria Terminus), one of India’s busiest train stations built in the Gothic style dating back to 1887-88, travelling with a local train, visiting a local market, or trying some of the world’s best teas in a local tea house in Mumbai. While you do so you are bound to see the dabbawallah delivering meals or perhaps the washers at Dhobi Ghat, considered the world’s largest outdoor laundry.<br />\n  If you would like to compare American or European film-making with India’s industry, have an in-depth look at one of the Bollywood studios and try your own at dancing with a professional Bollywood dance team. </p>\n<p><b>Day 13 — Mumbai, India</b><br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark <i>Silver Discoverer. </i><br />\n</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice conditions.

Because of  the location between China and Europe and the spice trade the port and town  with the easy access to the sea used to be called “Queen of the Arabian Sea”.<br />\n  Around  noon, we expect to be welcomed with a traditional Kerala <em>shinkari melam</em>, a group of musicians playing traditional  instruments.</p>\n<p>We  will use the afternoon and the following day to get a better insight into this  port and the surrounding area and will drive through one of India’s most  beautiful and tranquil landscapes to visit Alleppey, the “City of Canals” or  “Venice of the East”, located south of Cochin between the Arabian Sea and Lake  Vembanad, India’s longest lake.</p>\n<p>Alleppey’s  port was opened to foreign trade by the British in the late 18th century to end  the Dutch commercial supremacy in Cochin.

It is  the largest city in this part of India and also the capital of the state of  Kerala. The Padmanabhaswamy Temple, the world’s richest temple, can be found in  Thiruvananthapuram. Uncounted objects in gold and silver, some of them studded  with precious stones have been guarded inside the temple in various vaults that  are rarely if ever opened. Estimates of the objects’ value seen so far on few  occasions supervised by members of the Indian government and the royal families  involved go into the billions of US-dollars. Unfortunately for us, neither can  we see these objects, nor can we enter the temple (unless you profess Hindu  faith), but outside views are quite spectacular too.</p>\n<p>Instead  of Thiruvananthapuram you might chose to drive south to Chakala to visit Padmanabhapuram,  the largest wooden palace in India, dating back to the 16th century. The palace  is a fine specimen of Keralan architecture with antique interiors, intricate  rosewood carvings and sculpted décor. The sheer size, style and materials are  overwhelming –the palace used to feed 2000 people on a daily basis with a hall  able to accommodate everyone. Part of this excursion is a typical Sadya lunch  and a Kathakali dance performance.<br />\n  Sadya  is a festive vegetarian meal served on banana leafs and is usually reserved for  important temple festivals or other special celebrations. The Kathakali dance  has evolved over the last 400 years to become the most popular and sacred dance  drama of Kerala. Rigorous training is needed to attain complete control of the  body to be able to render all its nuances through hand gestures and facial  expressions. The themes presented usually centre on the Ramayana and the  Mahabharata, two of the great Indian epics. </p>\n<p>During  the evening, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will  leave and head for Sri Lanka and Galle, </p>\n<p><b>Days 9-10 — Galle,  Sri Lanka </b><br />\n  While <em>Silver Discoverer</em> is sailing through  the Laccadive Sea on a southeasterly course, our experts will offer talks and  presentations about Sri Lanka. <br />\n  Our  Chef might explain some of the secrets behind the preparation of culinary  highlights, or the Bar Team might tempt you with special cocktails or wine  tasting. The outer decks are there to relax and unwind, although you might also  want to help our naturalists looking for marine life or seabirds from the  bridgewing.<br />\n  After  lunch, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will  approach Galle and Sri Lanka.<br />\n  As  soon as we have been cleared into Sri Lanka, we want to explore the ancient  port of Galle and surrounding area. We intend to visit Galle and its  magnificent fort. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988 as the best  example of a fortified city built by Europeans in South and South-East Asia  showing the interaction between European architectural styles and South Asian  traditions, it is surrounded by the sea on three sides. Some of the colonial Dutch  architecture has survived and the National Museum of Galle uses a building  going back to 1656, the oldest remaining Dutch building in the fort. The three  galleries have collections not only going back to the Portuguese, Dutch and British  periods, but also include displays of the 15th century expeditions of Chinese  Admiral Zheng He.<br />\n  <br />\n  On  Day 10 we intend to visit a working tea plantation near the small village of  Akuressa. This privately owned property is the only organic tea factory in  southern Sri Lanka. The head planter will introduce you to the fascinating  process of tea production. You will walk the fields, see the picking of the tea  leafs by the local women and partake in a tea tasting session. <br />\n  Afterwards  we head for the sea and will enjoy a special seafood barbecue lunch at what is  considered one of the best beaches in Sri Lanka. A group of Sri Lankan Baila  musicians will perform during the lobster, king prawn, tiger prawn, crab fish  and shellfish barbecue.<br />\n  Golden  sand, a protected bay and excellent swimming will later permit you to return  refreshed to <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.<br />\n  <br />\n  <b>Day 11 —  Kirinda, Sri Lanka </b><br />\n  Early  in the morning, we will start from the fishing port of Kirinda for a visit to Yala  National Park. Yala began as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900 and in 1938 it was declared  a National Park. Situated in the southeast of Sri Lanka, the park covers 979  square kilometres. A wide variety of wild animals live in the park, including  one of the highest densities of leopards in the world. Of the 215 bird species  known six are endemic. Another important factor of the park is the conservation  of Sri Lankan elephants in it.&nbsp; <br />\n  Within  the park we will use 4WD vehicles with local trackers and naturalists and will  learn about the leopards, with information on the animal, its habitat, and the  conservation work that has gone (and is going) on to protect the animals.<br />\n  You  will have a Champagne brunch at a scenic spot in the forest. As a special treat,  one Sri Lanka’s leading conservationists will talk about birding and  conservation in Sri Lanka. </p>\n<p><b>Days 12-13 —  Trincomalee, Sri Lanka </b><br />\n  From  Trincomalee there will be two options for full day tours. Both destinations are  UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the first option is to drive to the former capital  of the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. Dating back to the 12th century, the ancient  city is an excellent example of how irrigation systems were planned to be able  to maximise the use of rain. Its ruins and statues are still today  overpowering. The excursion to Polonnaruwa will include a visit to the museum  where by special arrangement the museum’s curator will be at hand to answer any  questions. <br />\n  A  special buffet lunch will be arranged in the wilderness, and while you have your  meal, a traditional Sri Lankan folk show will take place for you.<br />\n  Alternatively  travel to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Sigiriya- the city of the Rock  Fortress. Sigiriya is Asia’s best-preserved city centre dating back to the  first millennium. Its particular interest goes back to the 5th century, when  parricidal King Kassapa fled to the peak of reddish gneiss known as Lion’s  Rock. This massive column of rock was used for the construction of his palace.  It is known that the area had been in use for centuries and was used as a  Buddhist monastery after Kassapa died. <br />\n  A  massive wall defends part of the lower city. Various features have been  overgrown by the forests and while one part has not yet been fully excavated,  the other part is known to have been the aristocratic quarter with terraced  gardens, canals and fountains. <br />\n  On  arrival in Sigiriya, we will first visit the museum to get a good overview of  the fortress, its history, the objects found and those excavated. Here too the  museum’s curator will be at your disposal to answer any questions that you  might have regarding the legendary citadel.<br />\n  To see  the top one has to climb special staircases. At the summit of the rock is the  fortified palace with its ruined buildings, its cisterns and its rock sculptures.  Apart from the archaeological remains of the palace and city, Sigiriya is  famous for the “Mirror Wall”. The surface of the rock had been polished to such  an extreme that one could see one’s reflection. Halfway up the rock, within an  inaccessible rocky shelter in the vertical wall of the western face, are rock  paintings known as 'The Maidens of the Clouds', 21 beautiful female figures.  The climb is not easy and takes approximately 2 hours.<br />\n  A  sumptuous Sri Lankan lunch –well deserved after the climb- will be served at a  nearby hotel before returning to <em>Silver  Discoverer</em>. </p>\n<p><b>Day 14 — At  Sea, cruising the Bay of Bengal </b><br />\n  Our  final day at sea will give you a chance to attend last presentations or  seminars, taste some culinary specialties –perhaps comparing Sri Lankan and  Indian food- and edit your many photos before the onboard  Photographer/Videographer presents the official Voyage-DVD, highlighting the  many interesting objects, animals and sights seen and activities done. </p>\n<p><b>Day 15 — Chennai, India</b><strong> </strong><br />\n  Following breakfast,  disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>. </p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences  only and cannot be guaranteed.

After a mandatory safety drill head out onto the Pool Deck for a ‘Sail Away’  party, leaving Chennai behind.<br />\n  Later during  the afternoon, the Expedition Team and important crew members will be  introduced.<br />\n  In the evening,  enjoy the first of many fine dining experiences in The Restaurant and relax in  the Discoverer Lounge or on the open decks.</p>\n<p><b>Day 2 — At Sea </b><br />\n  Today, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will head along  India’s east coast in a northeasterly direction. Meet some of your fellow  explorers on the outer decks, helping our naturalists looking for seabirds and  marine life. You can also attend one of several presentations offered by our  experts, or learn about the preparation of culinary highlights presented by our  Chef.<br />\n  This  evening the Captain will invite you to the Captain’s Welcome Cocktail and our  Chef and Restaurant Manager would like to see you in The Restaurant for a  special Welcome Dinner. </p>\n<p><b>Day 3 — Visakhapatnam, India </b><br />\n  Early in the  morning, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will enter  the only natural harbour on India’s east coast, going alongside in Visakhapatnam.  Sometimes called “Goa of the East”, the French and English had an interest in  this city, the harbour and India’s oldest shipyard.<br />\n  Despite the  Metropolitan Region claiming more than 5,000,000 people, Visakhapatnam is  considered one of the cleanest cities in India. The beautiful hills of the  Eastern Ghats flank the city on the northern and western side, and the  Kambalakonda Wildlife Sanctuary is just north of the city. Different animals  can be observed, including the Indian Paradise Flycatcher, quails, partridges,  Indian Peafowl, spotted deer and Indian jackals. The nocturnal Indian leopard  is found here, too. We will visit the Eco Park and will look for its fauna and  flora.<br />\n  Another  interesting geological feature, actually considered one of India’s geo-heritage  sites, is an area north of Kambalakonda: the red sand dunes known as Erra Matti  Dibbaw.<br />\n  The region has  had a strong Buddhist influence in former times, as attested by the many  archaeological remains, but today Hinduism, Islam and Christianity are the main  religions. </p>\n<p><b>Day 4 — At Sea </b><br />\n  Continuing  along India’s east coast, our lecturers will take the opportunity to present  topics related to the Bay of Bengal and the upcoming visit to the Sundarbans.<br />\n  Attend a  seminar, or relax on the outer decks, letting our Bar Team prepare the  refreshment of your choice. <br />\n  If you think  you need some exercise, The Gym will be at hand; if you are more inclined to  have a massage, visit The Spa.</p>\n<p><b>Day 5 — Mongla  Port, Bangladesh </b><br />\n  <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be sailing through the Sundarbans up  the Mongla River to reach Mongla Port, one of Bangladesh’s important seaports  –although found inland- to clear into the country.<br />\n  While  we travel up the river, spend time on the outer decks to get a first impression  of the world’s largest mangrove forest. Alternatively, attend lecture  presentation or talks to know more about this fascinating part of the Indian  subcontinent.</p>\n<p><b>Days 6-8 — Sundarbans,  Bangladesh</b><br />\n  Named after the Sundari trees, the Sundarbans is an area reaching from  Bangladesh into India. While the Indian part is a National Park, Bangladesh’s  part consists of three Wildlife Sanctuaries. The Sundarbans ecosystem is quite  unique: spreading over an area of approximately 10,000 square kilometres, it is  the largest halophytic mangrove forest in the world. It represents the largest  mangal diversity in the world with 81 mangal plant species and it provides  habitat for the threatened Bengal tiger (<em>Panthera  tigris tigris</em>). The Indian core area (Sundarbans National Park) has been  designated as a World Heritage Site in 1987; the three Wildlife Sanctuaries in  Bangladesh were inscribed in 1997. The whole area has the largest amount of the  famous Bengal tigers –an estimated 350 of them roam the Sundarbans. These  animals however are very hard to see. Other wildlife species present are  macaques, Indian grey mongoose, leopard cats, Ridley sea turtle, wild boar,  jungle cat, flying foxes, and spotted deers (Chital). The mangrove ecosystem of  the Sundarbans is considered to be unique because of its immensely rich  mangrove flora and mangrove-associated fauna. It is also unique as the  mangroves are not only dominant as fringing mangroves along the creeks and  backwaters, but also grow along the sides of rivers in muddy as well as in  flat, sandy areas. <br />\n  During  the three days we will spend here, <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> will be mainly based in the Pashur River. We will be accompanied  by local guides and rangers. <br />\n  We  intend go ashore at Hiron Point for natural history walks and possibly an  exploratory Zodiac cruise. This is where we will pick up local rangers. After  our first impressions we will head back to <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> to escape the mid-day heat. During the late morning, while the  ship will reposition to Kokilmoni, attend an informative talk about the  Sundarbans by one of the local lecturers. <br />\n  During  the afternoons, we will take to the Zodiacs to look for aquatic mammals that  frequent the tidal waters, including the Ganges dolphin, Indo-Pacific  humpbacked dolphin, Irrawaddy dolphin and finless porpoise, while on land we  might see wild boar, spotted deer, and rhesus macaques. <br />\n  Birders  will be on the look-out for White-bellied Sea Eagles, Brahminy Kites,  Intermediate Egrets, Indian Pond Heron, as well as Collared and Black-capped  Kingfisher. As the best time for wildlife observation here is around sunset, we  will stay out until late.<br />\n  Depending  on where the Captain has repositioned the ship, we might again board <em>Silver Discoverer</em> near the Kokilmoni  Forest Station, where the ship will stay overnight.<br />\n  In  the very early morning of our second and third day in the Sundarbans we will  offer ‘first light’ Zodiac cruises into the mangrove forest. The narrow  channels are known to have Stork-billed and Brown-winged Kingfisher, Oriental  Magpie Robins, White Wagtails, and many other birds. During our cruises we will  take time to drift, which will permit us to hear birdsong all the better. <br />\n  We  might also see some of the local fishermen active on the river. In time for  late breakfasts we will return to <em>Silver  Discoverer</em> and attend more lectures about the Sundarbans, while the ship  repositions to Harbaria Forest Station or other points of interest.<br />\n  At  Harbaria we intend to offer a combined Zodiac cruise and natural history walk.  Well maintained boardwalks will permit us to enter the mangrove forest without  engine-noise. Rhesus macaques are regularly seen, but this walk will give a  great opportunity to see the different plant species our lecturers talked  about: cedar mangrove, cannonball mangrove, sea holly, sea mango, blinding  mangrove, nipa palm, and Phoenix palm. Not only will our botanically inclined  guests love to take the boardwalk and pathways (groups are always accompanied  by one of the rangers), but anybody interested in Nature will want to take this  unique opportunity to walk through the world’s largest mangrove forest.</p>\n<p><b>Day 9 — Moheshkhali  Island, Bangladesh </b><br />\n  At Moheshkhali we will see the real rural  Bangladesh. <br />\n  During  the morning, we intend to take our Zodiacs to go ashore and to explore the  small village with its school and temple. To get a feeling of how the locals  live, we will take local transport (rickshaws and tuk tuks) and visit a  Buddhist temple, meeting the monks and getting to know the daily routine of the  apprentices and monks themselves. Later we visit the school (where our/your  donations will be very welcome) and a group of Burmese weavers will be showing  us the use of traditional equipment. The cotton products these ladies prepare  will be on offer as well. We will then have time to visit a small Rakhayn (Burmese)  community at Thakur Tala village before heading back by Zodiac to have lunch  aboard <em>Silver Discoverer</em>. Moheshkhali  is not at all touristy and our visit should be a good opportunity for us to  interact with local communities.<br />\n  In  the late afternoon, we hope to once again take to the Zodiacs, this time to see  life on the river banks. We should be able to see fishermen which will be  fishing in little boats or with nets from the shore, and will pass areas where  small wooden ships are being repaired. We also plan to go ashore at Sonadia  Island to see one of the fishing camps and should get to see the oxen after  which the island is named (Mahisa is buffalo in the local language).</p>\n<p>Day 10 — St.  Martins Island, Bangladesh <br />\n  St.  Martin’s Island and Chera Dwip are Bangladesh’s southernmost islands and are  actually connected at low tide. These are the only coralline islands and as  such have been protected with only limited access for many years.<br />\n  Turtles  come to nest on the beaches, and the beach morning glories and palm trees give  the impression of a South Sea island.<br />\n  We  will go ashore to explore the small island(s) and depending on the tide intend  to offer swimming and snorkelling. </p>\n<p><b>Day 11 — Sittwe and Kalandan River,  Bangladesh</b><br />\n  Once  Silver Discoverer’s has arrived in our first port in Myanmar –and shortly after  the authorities have cleared the ship in- we will have a look at the capital of  Myanmar’s Rakhine State and one of the most important ports along Myanmar’s Bay  of Bengal coast. <br />\n  Visiting  the capital, we hope to see the Shwezedi monastery, quite important in  Myanmar’s modern history. Since Myanmar has recognized more than 135 ethnic  groups and the Rakhine State Cultural Museum gives a good overview of this  particular ethnic group. <br />\n  With  our Zodiacs we intend to explore the Kalandan River during the afternoon. We  intend to take the Zodiacs not only up the river, but into smaller channels and  would like to see one of the local villages. Further inland the river forms the  border between India and Myanmar. </p>\n<p><b>Day 12 —  Ngapali, Myanmar </b><br />\n  With  its 15 miles of white beaches, fringed by palm trees, Ngapali has attracted  visitors who look for an unspoilt coast and simply want to relax.<br />\n  We  will go ashore during the afternoon and it is yours to decide whether you want  to unwind on the beach or perhaps do some exercise and hike in the nearby  rainforest.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Day 13 — At Sea </b><br />\n  While <em>Silver Discoverer</em> sails along the  coast of Ayeyarwady, one of Myanmar’s regions, our lecture staff will be on  hand to offer a selection of informative and interesting talks and  presentations.<br />\n  The  Spa and Gym are other options to spend your time –and you can be pampered by  our Bar and Restaurant Teams. The choice is yours. <br />\n  In  the afternoon, our onboard Videographer/Photographer will present the  Voyage-DVD, &nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Day 14 —  Yangon, Myanmar </b><br />\n  <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will sail up the Yangon River, and will  go alongside in the very heart of Yangon.<br />\n  Today  we will see one of the largest reclining Buddha in the world at the  Chaukhtatgyi Pagoda<br />\n  and  will visit the world-famous 2,500-year-old Shwedagon Pagoda. The top of the  stupa is said to be adorned with more than 5,400 diamonds and more than 2,300  rubies. So much gold and so many gold leafs have been applied to the pagoda  over the centuries that it is estimated the stupa has more gold than the  Republic of Myanmar has officially as gold reserves. Venerated as a symbol of  architectural perfection the glittering golden stupa is considered the  appearance of Gautama Buddha in the present world — certainly a highlight. <br />\n  To  celebrate our arrival into Yangon and the end of our voyage, we will enjoy a  very special evening ashore. At the end of our excursion we will be driven to  the Karaweik Palace Restaurant where a myriad of Myanmar flavours along with a  cultural presentation of Myanmar traditional music and dances will be another  highlight of our voyage. </p>\n<p><b>Day 15 — Yangon, Myanmar</b><strong> </strong><br />\n  Following  breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>. </p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only  and cannot be guaranteed.

After a mandatory safety drill, the Expedition Team and important crew members will be introduced.<br />\n  In the evening, enjoy the first of many fine dining experiences in The Restaurant and relax in the Explorer Lounge listening to the music played by our Pianist. <br />\n  As Silver Discoverer will not be leaving until tomorrow afternoon, you might want to explore Yangon’s nightlife.</p>\n<p><b>Day 2 — Yangon, Myanmar</b><br />\n  During the day you will see one of the largest reclining Buddha in the world at the Chaukhtatgyi Pagoda<br />\n  and visit the world-famous 2,500-year-old Shwedagon Pagoda. The top of the stupa is said to be adorned with 5,488 diamonds and 2,317 rubies. Venerated as a symbol of architectural perfection the glittering golden stupa is considered the appearance of Gautama Buddha in the present world — certainly a highlight. If you wish you can visit the National Museum with its excellent exhibits of some of the more than 135 different ethnic groups present in Myanmar.</p>\n<p><b>Day 3 — At Sea, cruising the Andaman Sea</b><br />\n  Today our Expedition Team will present lectures about the history and natural history of the Mergui Archipelago preparing you for the next three days of exploration within this group of more than 800 islands spread out over 36.000 km². This is a prime location for water activities, and our Marine Biologist will likely want to talk about Mergui’s underwater residents. Temperatures range between 24° and 32° C for the air and 26°-29°C for the water, making it quite agreeable for swimming and snorkelling.</p>\n<p><b>Day 4 — Lampi Island, Mergui Archipelago, Myanmar</b><br />\n  During our first day in the archipelago we want to see what Kyun Tan Shey (Lampi Island) located in the Lampi Group can offer us. Lampi was established in 1995 as Myanmar’s first marine national park. It is rich in biodiversity, mangroves and coral reefs. The officially uninhabited island, apart from having occasional fishing nomads stop over, is large enough to hold wild animals. With rainforest and a fringing coral reef, Lampi’s outstanding beauty is enhanced by spotting monkeys, hornbills and sea eagles. From the Zodiacs you can witness some of the area’s exotic flora and fauna. <br />\n  The surrounding islands offer beaches regardless of tides. More than 50 white sand beaches and fringing reefs wait to be used for snorkelling, bird-watching or just relaxing.<br />\n  At this spectacular island we will look for the opportunity of a Zodiac cruise and to offer water based activities from one of the beaches. </p>\n<p><b>Day 5 — Bo Cho and Frost Island, Mergui Archipelago, Myanmar</b><br />\n  Located south of Lampi Island, Bo Cho Island is a sacred home for the Moken (Sea Gypsy) people who refer to the island with their own name of Pu Nala. A small Moken resettlement zone has been established here and now there is a year-round Moken village. The people were so connected to the ocean that their first houses were all built on stilts near the shore where they could keep a watchful eye on their boats and the sea. Close to 1000 Moken people have made Bo Cho their home and a basic infrastructure supports them. There will be the chance meeting them and to see their unique boat designs. <br />\n  Around noon, Silver Discoverer is scheduled to sail south passing Buda Island. In the afternoon, we will visit Frost Island, one of the smaller islands in the Mid-Group. Here and at the neighbouring island there are perfect beaches for relaxation, while in the water hard and soft corals teem with colourful tropical fishes.</p>\n<p><b>Day 6 — Myauk Phyu and Kawthaung, Mergui Archipelago, Myanmar</b><br />\n  During the early morning, Silver Discoverer should arrive at Myauk Phyu Island. Our last morning in the archipelago will be used to explore the beaches and water around the uninhabited Myauk Phyu, right next to Hastings Island and the other adjacent uninhabited islands. Long white-sand beaches, clear water and birdsong ashore will captivate nature lovers. Our snorkelers will take up the opportunity to see corals and vibrant fishes, while others might simply relax on a nearby beach, or indulge in a refreshing swim.<br />\n  During lunch, Silver Discoverer relocates to Kawthaung to clear out of Myanmar. Interestingly enough the town has a strong Muslim and Indian influence and a Buddhist monastery atop the hill to the north. <br />\n  As this is a technical stop only, it is unlikely that we will go ashore.<br />\n  Instead, members of our Expedition Team will likely take the opportunity to offer various talks preparing you for our next destination and country.</p>\n<p><b>Day 7 — Koh Miang, Similan Islands, Thailand</b><br />\n  Found in the Andaman Sea, the Similan Islands are off the coast of Thailand’s Phan Nga Province. Originally only nine (similan in the local language) islands made up the group, but two remote islands have been added to the Mu Koh Similan National Park, which now covers over 140 square kilometers. The Similan Islands are surrounded by crystal clear shallow waters that harbor interesting rock formations and coral reefs. <br />\n  The marine life around the islands is the best in Thailand. Surrounded by sea depths averaging 60 feet, the Similan Islands are also some of Thailand’s best dive sites and offer top snorkeling opportunities. The reefs are estimated to be 5000 year old and the underwater visibility generally runs more than 30 metres. Marine life includes manta rays, moray eels, jacks, and sea snakes, grouper, tuna, barracuda, and diverse reef fish, as well as lobster, whitetip reef sharks and turtles. If we are lucky, we might even spot whale sharks that are known to congregate in the Similan Islands in January and February.<br />\n  As Koh Miang is famous for its white powdered beaches and lush forests, we also intend to do a little exploration ashore.</p>\n<p><b>Day 8 — Koh Ra Wi, Thailand </b><br />\n  Today we venture into the Ko Tarutao Marine Park. The park was established in 1974 and the roughly 50 under-developed and jungle-covered islands are well off the beaten track and rarely visited by expedition ships. Our fleet of Zodiacs will make the journey to the island of Koh Ra Wi, where local guides will be waiting to brief us and introduce the island. <br />\n  Our goal this morning is a viewpoint called “Pha Chado”, an observation point for pirates in the past. Nowadays, this stunning overlook requires about 40 minutes of walking to reach the top. Well worth the effort, the view from the Chado cliff overlooks lines of trees and the white sandy capes of nearby islands. Gratified by the view, return to the beach where a selection of seasonal fruits awaits you. If time allows following the hike, the marine park offers excellent snorkelling and swimming. </p>\n<p>By lunchtime, we will bid farewell to Thailand and board Silver Discoverer. During the afternoon, we will be crossing the Malacca Strait in a southerly direction, heading for Indonesia.  Enjoy a relaxing afternoon and take in a lecture presentation to prepare you for our time in Sumatra. </p>\n<p><b>Day 9 — Belawan, Sumatra, Indonesia</b><br />\n  Quite early, Silver Discoverer will go alongside in Belawan, Sumatra’s busiest port. Built originally to export tobacco, rubber and later palm oil, Belawan today is an important port for containers, and exports now include coffee and tea. Here we expect the local authorities to clear the ship before sunrise.<br />\n  For us Belawan is the gate to Gunung Leuser National Park. Located in the interior of Sumatra, running along the Barisan mountain-ridge from Aceh towards the southeast, the park covers an area of some 9000 square kilometres –and apart from being one of Indonesia’s oldest and possibly least visited parks is part of the UNESCO World Heritage site “Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra”.<br />\n  The park is quite mountainous and home to more than 120 species of mammals, 190 species of reptiles and amphibians, as well as more than 350 species of birds. More than 4000 plant species, including such interesting plants as the corpse flower and titan arum can be found in the park. Our reason to come here is to look for the Sumatran orangutan.<br />\n  Before visiting the Bukit Lawang Visitor Center to learn about the flora and fauna of the park, we will have breakfast at the Rindu Alam Restaurant. We will be briefed by a ranger about our visit and hike for approximately two hours in the park. The former Bohorok Orangutan Rehabilitation Center had released more than 200 of the Sumatran orangutan back into the wild before it had to close. Apart from Sumatran orangutan there are eight other primate species present in the park. We hope to see several during our forest walk. </p>\n<p><b>Day 10 — At Sea, cruising the Malacca Strait</b><br />\n  On approach to Singapore, Silver Discoverer will sail through the Malacca Strait with Malaysia on the northern side and Indonesia’s Sumatra on starboard, the southern side. <br />\n  Today will be an opportunity to edit all the photos taken, or to attend final presentations and lectures about Myanmar, Thailand and/or Sumatra. <br />\n  The Chef and Sommelier might want to present culinary highlights and the wines to accompany them, while the Spa and Gym are ready for you –in case you want to exercise or be pampered.<br />\n  During the afternoon, the onboard Videographer/Photographer will present the Voyage-DVD. You will be astonished passing review of all the highlights seen and activities done during the last 10 days.</p>\n<p><b>Day 11 — Singapore, Singapore</b><br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark Silver Discoverer. <br />\n</p>\n<p>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Expedition Highlights:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />\n  • Follow  in the footsteps of the great Antarctic explorers and visit sites that Byrd,  Charcot, Fiennes, de Gerlache, Shackleton, and Weddell explored.<br />\n  • Visit  one of South America’s most important paleontological museums and explore South  America’s first paleontological park looking for ancient fossils.<br />\n  • Visit  the Valdes Peninsula, a UNESCO World Heritage Site<br />\n  • Hike  across New Island and West Point Island to see Black-browed Albatross.<br />\n  • See  snow-covered mountains, mighty glaciers and spectacular icebergs.<br />\n  •  Encounter Rockhopper, Gentoo, Macaroni, Adelie, Magellanic and Chinstrap  Penguins, and with some luck also King Penguins.<br />\n  • Watch for Commerson’s and Peale dolphins in  the Falkland Islands and Southern right whales close to the Valdes Peninsula.</p>\n<p><em>Silver Cloud</em> will have kayaks onboard that will allow small groups  to explore South Georgia and Antarctica in a unique way –accompanied and  supervised by certified kayak instructors. These kayak excursions have limited  space; they require a certain level of fitness and will also depend on local  conditions for safe operation. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 — Buenos Aires, Argentina</strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Cloud</em> in Buenos Aires and meet some  of your fellow explorers as you become acquainted with the luxurious amenities  found on board.<br />\n  A  mandatory safety drill will take place before you set sail. During the  afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and important members  of the crew. </p>\n<p>At  sail-away say goodbye to the Capital of Tango –Tango is recognized as an  Intangible Heritage by UNESCO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Days 2-3 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Take the  opportunity to relax after your long flight to join <em>Silver Cloud</em> in Buenos Aires and have a leisurely breakfast before  you join one of the talks by our Expedition Team members. These talks will  cover a wide range of subjects –from geology to history, biology and even  botany (to be seen in the Falkland Islands). </p>\n<p>You will  also be invited to attend a special Welcome Aboard cocktail party hosted by the  Captain, who will introduce his senior officers and various members of the <em>Silver Cloud</em> crew.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Puerto Madryn, Argentina</strong><br />\n  Puerto  Madryn is the starting point for two different excursions: a full day tour to  the Valdes Peninsula (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) to see Southern right  whales, penguins and seals or an extended half day tour to see one of the most  accessible fossil sites in Argentina.</p>\n<p>To reach  the Valdes Peninsula and its attractions one has to travel close to 100  kilometres by bus. Sea lions, fur seals and elephant seals are found along the  shore of the peninsula, as well as orcas. Southern right whales can be found in  the two bays adjacent to the peninsula. A museum and interpretive centre will  introduce you to the terrestrial and aquatic fauna of Patagonia and permits a  view of both gulfs (Golfo Nuevo and Golfo San Jose) from a watchtower at the  narrowest part of the isthmus connecting Valdes Peninsula with the mainland. A  site of global significance for the conservation of marine mammals the  peninsula will be one of the highlights of this voyage.</p>\n<p>If you  are more interested in the evolution of animals and fossils, the Museo  Paleontologico Egidio Feruglio and the Paleontological Park Bryn Gwyn (some 70  kilometres south of Puerto Madryn) will be to your liking. Both the museum and  the park have an outstanding collection of fossils from the last 40 million  years and will show the evolution of life in this part of Patagonia.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Taking  advantage of the day at sea, the Expedition Team will present talks about the  Falkland Islands (Malvinas -as the Spanish-speaking world calls them) that will  prepare you for the exciting adventures ahead.&nbsp;  Birders out on deck want to keep an eye out for Black-browed Albatross,  Southern Giant Petrels and Cape Petrels. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — New Island and West Point Island,  Falkland Islands</strong><br />\n  Today  you have two opportunities to enjoy the remarkable beauty of the remote  Falkland Islands. <br />\n  During  the morning we will visit New Island, a wildlife and nature reserve. The New  Island Conservation Trust, a private environmental conservation group, protects  its many birds and animals. Our Zodiacs will take us ashore near the island’s small  settlement at Coffin Harbour. From there we will hike past the Barnard Memorial  Museum crossing the island from east to west to reach the rocky cliffs and a  rookery where Rockhopper Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags share the same nesting  area. We will also observe Black-browed Albatross going about their daily  routines and may even spot Upland Geese on our hike.<br />\n  Our  onboard Historian might tell us about ‘Barnard’s barn’ — a stone structure once  belonging to an early settler and now a museum, as well as the wreck of <em>Protector III</em> — an old minesweeper used  for seal hunting, now grounded not too far from our landing site.<br />\n  <br />\n  During  lunch <em>Silver Cloud</em> will sail in a  northeasterly direction to West Point Island. Peale’s dolphins and Commerson’s  dolphins with their distinctive black and white markings can often be spotted  as one approaches West Point Island. </p>\n<p>Our  Zodiacs will take us to a jetty from where we will walk slightly less than 2  miles to Devil’s Nose. Walking across rolling moorland and past gorse we will  be observed by Grass Wrens, Long-tailed Meadowlarks, Falkland Thrushes,  Striated Caracaras and Turkey Vultures, but our goal is to reach colonies of  Black-browed Albatross that nest side-by-side with Rockhopper Penguins. The  winds at Devil’s Nose are usually so strong that the albatross only have to  spread their wings to take off, while the penguins (as their name implies) have  to hop from rock to rock to reach either the shore or their nests.</p>\n<p>Once  back at the farm, the hospitable island owners will invite you to have tea,  coffee and home-made cakes and cookies and are always happy to answer your  questions and share their stories.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Stanley, Falkland Islands</strong><br />\n  Stanley  is the capital of the remote Falkland Islands, and –although Argentine  authorities have repeatedly claimed the islands as part of their country- has a  distinct British ambience. A reminder of the 1982 Falkland Conflict between Britain  and Argentina is the Liberation Memorial.<br />\n  <br />\n  Opt to  take a ‘city tour’ by bus with a local guide or stroll through the charming  streets of this colourful little town, lined with quaint cottages and a variety  of traditional pubs. Visit the 19th-century Anglican cathedral (the  southernmost Anglican cathedral in the world) and wander through the Falkland  Islands Dockyard Museum. For stamp collectors a visit to the Philatelic Bureau  is a must.</p>\n<p>Depending  on local conditions there might be the chance to see Gentoo, Magellanic or King  Penguins. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Leaving  the Falkland Islands behind, <em>Silver Cloud</em> will head for the South Shetland Islands and Antarctica. </p>\n<p>The day  at sea will be used to present further lectures. As we are heading for Elephant  Island, our onboard Historian might talk about Shackleton’s <em>Endurance</em> expedition and the crew  members awaiting their rescue at Point Wild, while our Marine Biologist and  Ornithologist will cover the wildlife to be seen.</p>\n<p>As part  of the preparation to visit Antarctica, briefings regarding correct procedures  when going ashore and a thorough inspection of clothing and outdoor gear will  take place. Participate in other onboard activities or peruse an array of  titles and topics in the well-stocked Library. Take a stroll on deck and enjoy  the solitude and splendour of the vast sea and sky.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands</strong><br />\n  Awesome glaciers  and steep cliffs greet us as we approach Elephant Island — so named for its  former abundance of elephant seals. The island is home to several Chinstrap  Penguin rookeries, Antarctic fur seals and elephant seals as well as old moss  colonies. Weddell seals and Macaroni Penguins can also be found here.</p>\n<p>When Sir  Ernest Shackleton’s ship <em>Endurance</em> was crushed in pack ice in the Weddell Sea in late 1915, the crew was eventually  stranded on the island for 135 days. A solitary bronze bust can be seen at  Point Wild, honouring the Chilean pilot Luis Pardo, who took the cutter <em>Yelcho</em> across the Drake Passage to  rescue Shackleton’s men.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Days 10-14 — Antarctic Peninsula</strong><br />\n  While  sailing along the Antarctic Peninsula, every turn can reveal a new and breathtaking  adventure. The pack ice becomes thicker the closer we are moving into  Antarctica’s vast white wilderness. Remote and otherworldly, Antarctica is  irresistible for its spectacular iceberg sculptures and calving glaciers, and  for the possibility of close encounters with marine mammals. As late spring is  the beginning of the Antarctic season, <em>Silver  Cloud</em> will take you to seemingly untouched and never before visited sites. <br />\n  <br />\n  Watch  for seals sunbathing on slow-moving ice floes and for humpback, Minke, and orca  whales to surface from below the frigid waters. Each day we will attempt Zodiac  departures, and, if conditions permit, we will cruise amidst colourful icebergs  or step ashore to visit a variety of penguin rookeries and perhaps scientific  research stations on complimentary excursions led by our team of natural  history experts.</p>\n<p>A  flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of favourable sea and weather  conditions. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition  Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on weather, ice  conditions and wildlife we may encounter. Here are some of the places we may  visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Antarctic Sound</strong><br />\n  Named  after Nordenskjöld’s ship, this 30 miles long stretch of water at the north end  of the Antarctic Peninsula offers some of the best tabular iceberg  observations.</p>\n<p><strong>Brown Bluff, Tabarin Peninsula (a 2,225-foot  bluff on the Antarctic continent).</strong><br />\n  Brown  Bluff is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent  cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock. Adelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls,  and Cape Petrels use this as a breeding area. Birds such as the all-white Snow  Petrel and skuas might also be seen.<br />\n  <br />\n  As you  explore the area, Weddell seals may be seen basking in the sunlight. If  conditions permit, a hike onto a nearby glacier might be possible.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Cuverville Island, Errera Channel</strong><br />\n  The  island was discovered during de Gerlache’s <em>Belgica</em> expedition of 1897–99, and was named for a vice-admiral in the French navy. The  large, bare rock areas near the shore provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins,  but the penguins also look for exposed rocks on the slopes. Snow Petrels and  Cape Petrels may be seen, and Wilson’s Storm Petrels nest in the higher scree  of the island.</p>\n<p>Depending  on conditions a hike towards the top of the island for stunning panoramic views  might be offered. During Zodiac tours, we hope to see hauled-out Weddell seals.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Paradise Bay (Antarctic Peninsula)</strong><br />\n  The bay  is well named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs. From  the ship, observe Argentina’s “Base Brown”, one of many Antarctic research  stations. Close to the station Gentoo Penguins, Blue-eyed Shags, Antarctic  Terns, Kelp Gulls and skuas have all been seen nesting.</p>\n<p>Depending  on the conditions we can view the wildlife from sea level while cruising in our  Zodiacs or cruise the bay with <em>Silver  Cloud</em>. There’s a good chance you’ll come across a crabeater seal relaxing  on a nearby ice floe, or, if you’re very lucky, your Zodiac driver may locate a  Minke whale.</p>\n<p><strong>Neko Harbor</strong><br />\n  The site  is named after a whale factory ship which often used this bay –and Neko Harbor  still today offers good chances to see whales. A landing will provide an  opportunity to see Gentoo Penguin rookeries and quite possibly Weddell seals  and crabeater seals hauled out on the cobble beach. A hike to a lookout point will  be a good exercise and will be rewarded with panoramic views of the glacier,  Andvord Bay and the Gerlache Strait.</p>\n<p><strong>Port Lockroy, Goudier Island</strong><br />\n  The  British built a listening station on Goudier Island during WWII, which was then  used as a research station in the 1950s. Bransfield House was restored in 1996  and since then has acted as a museum and gift shop. The Antarctic Heritage  Trust operates a post office at the station which is open during summer. <br />\n  Snowy  Sheathbills and Gentoo Penguins roam outside the museum and leopard seals often  patrol the sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Port Foster, Whalers Bay (Deception Island)</strong><br />\n  Deception  Island is an excellent example of a caldera where it is believed that the  volcano’s summit collapsed with one section sinking far enough to allow the sea  to flood the interior. We plan to sail into the caldera through a narrow entrance  called Neptune’s Bellows and anchor in sight of the former whaling station and  the former British Antarctic Survey station.</p>\n<p>Our  resident Geologist will take the opportunity to explain the unique volcanic  features of the area and their importance for science, while our Historian  might introduce you to the whaling history of Deception Island. Still visible  on the island are the boilers used to make whale oil in the early 1900s. </p>\n<p>Conditions  permitting, we might hike to Neptune’s Window for spectacular panoramic views.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 15-16 — Drake Passage</strong><br />\n  The  Drake Passage has a notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to the funnelling  effect of the mountain ridges and seafloor pushing winds and water eastwards.  When <em>Silver Cloud</em> reaches the Antarctic  Convergence, a fluid and fluctuating natural boundary where cold polar waters from  the south meet warmer water moving southward, there is another good chance to  see whales and seabirds as nutrients are pushed to the surface by the different  currents.<br />\n  <br />\n  Spend  some time on deck watching Black-browed Albatross, Southern Giant Petrels,  Southern Fulmars, Cape Petrels and other seabirds gliding in the air currents  of <em>Silver Cloud’s</em> wake.</p>\n<p>There  will be opportunities to attend additional presentations offered by the Expedition  Team lecturers, to edit the countless photos taken and to socialize with new  friends as we travel north towards Ushuaia.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 17 — Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\n  After  breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Cloud</em> and  transfer to Ushuaia International Airport for your return flight to Buenos  Aires.</p>",

At  sail-away bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego, the ‘Land at the End of the World’. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 2–3 — Drake  Passage </strong><br />\n  The  Drake Passage has a notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to the  westerly winds and the funnelling effect of the passage’s seafloor. While  crossing the Drake Passage we will encounter the Antarctic Convergence, a  natural boundary between cold polar water flowing northward and warmer water  moving southward. The Antarctic Convergence is not a fixed line but moving,  depending on the season. Where these two currents meet, nutrients are pushed to  the surface, often attracting a multitude of seabirds and whales. Spend some  time on deck watching the Black-browed Albatross, Sooty Shearwaters and White-chinned  Petrels gliding in the air currents of <em>Silver  Cloud’s</em> wake. <br />\n  <br />\n  As  we set sail on our initial transit, familiarise yourself with the elegant <em>Silver Cloud </em>and the Expedition Team  members.

Here are some of the places we may  visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Aitcho Islands,  South Shetland Islands</strong> (just off the Antarctic Peninsula at the  entrance to the English Strait)<br />\n  Penguin  species here include Gentoo and Chinstrap. Other annual seabirds include the  Southern Giant Petrels. While heading back to the ship, you might see a leopard  seal patrolling the water.</p>\n<p><strong>Brown Bluff,  Tabarin Peninsula</strong> (a 2,200-foot bluff on mainland Antarctica)<br />\n  Brown  Bluff is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent  cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock.

This is one of the most  scenic passages in all of Antarctica. Only 7 miles long the steep walls on both  sides seem to make the channel even narrower than it is. The Lemaire Channel  leads to the Wilhelm Archipelago and it would be a shame not to be out on deck  watching the landscape pass by.</p>\n<p><strong>Petermann Island,  Wilhelm Archipelago</strong><br />\n  The  island is named for German geographer August Petermann and was first discovered  by a German expedition in 1873-74. Our onboard Geologist will take the  opportunity to point out various geological features. Rock surfaces show  glacial polish, some glacial grooving and nice samples of frost shattering. <br />\n  During  our landing, we will be able to observe rookeries of Adelie Penguins, Gentoo  Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags. A hike to the top will give views of extensive  iceberg areas towards the open waters.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Pleneau Island,  Wilhelm Archipelago</strong><br />\n  Pleneau  Island lies at the south end of the Lemaire Channel, and was first explored  during Charcot’s 1903–05 French Antarctic Expedition. The island was named for  the expedition’s photographer, Paul Pleneau.<strong> </strong>Amongst the common breeding birds are Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls  and South Polar Skuas. Southern elephant seals are often hauled-out ashore in  wallows. During a Zodiac cruise enjoy spectacular glacial and ice scenery.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Port Foster,  Whalers Bay</strong> (Deception Island)<br />\n  Deception  Island is home to a collapsed volcano and an excellent example of a caldera  where it is believed that the volcano’s summit collapsed with one section  sinking far enough to allow the sea to flood the interior. We plan to sail  inside this breached wall through a narrow entrance called Neptune’s  Bellows.&nbsp; <br />\n  Our  resident Geologist will take the opportunity to explain the unique volcanic  features of the area while our Naturalists might introduce you to the whaling  history of Deception Island. Still visible on the island are the boilers used  to make whale oil in the early 1900s.</p>\n<p><strong>Port Lockroy,  Goudier Island</strong> <br />\n  The  British built a listening station on Goudier Island during WWII, which was then  used as a research station in the 1950s and since 1996 as a museum and gift  shop. Snowy Sheathbills and Gentoo Penguins roam outside the museum. A special  souvenir from Port Lockroy might be a postcard sent from its post office.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 9–10 — Drake  Passage Return </strong><br />\n  Navigating our  return through the Drake Passage, we will watch for seabirds and wildlife we may  have missed on the first leg. Take the opportunity to attend additional  presentations offered by the Expedition Team lecturers and to swap photos with  new friends as we travel towards Ushuaia.</p>\n<p>The Captain will  invite you to a Farewell Cocktail and the on-board Photographer/Videographer  will present his/her voyage DVD permitting you to relive all the otherworldly  experiences in this pristine and magical continent.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Ushuaia,  Argentina</strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver  Cloud</em> and transfer to Ushuaia International Airport for your return flight  to Buenos Aires.</p>\n<em>Expedition highlights and  wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.  Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities  for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the  prevailing weather, wildlife activity and ice conditions.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Expedition Highlights:</strong><br />\n  • Follow  in the footsteps of the great Antarctic explorers and visit sites that Byrd,  Charcot, Cook, Fiennes, de Gerlache, Shackleton, and Weddell explored.<br />\n  • Spend  Christmas Eve in Stanley and New Year at Elephant Island.<br />\n  • See  snow-covered mountains, mighty glaciers and spectacular icebergs.<br />\n  •  Encounter Rockhopper, Gentoo, Macaroni, King, Adelie, Magellanic and Chinstrap  Penguins.<br />\n  • Watch for seals, dolphins, and whales.<br />\n  •  Identify seabirds, including different species of albatross, shearwaters and  petrels.</p>\n<p><em>Silver Cloud</em> will have kayaks onboard that will allow small  groups to explore South Georgia and Antarctica in a unique way –accompanied and  supervised by certified kayak instructors. These kayak excursions have limited  space; they require a certain level of fitness and will also depend on local  conditions for safe operation.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 — Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\n  Departing  from Buenos Aires, fly to Ushuaia and transfer to the port. Embark <em>Silver Cloud</em> and meet some of your  fellow explorers as you become acquainted with the luxurious amenities found on  board.<br />\n  A  mandatory safety drill will take place before you set sail. During the  afternoon you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and important members  of the crew. </p>\n<p>At  sail-away enjoy the mountain-lined shoreline of the Beagle Channel while you  leave Ushuaia and bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego, the ‘Land at the End of the  World’.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Taking  advantage of the day at sea, the Expedition Team will present talks about the  Falkland Islands (Malvinas -as the Spanish-speaking world calls them) that will  prepare you for the exciting adventures ahead. Birders out on deck want to keep  an eye out for Black-browed Albatross, Southern Giant Petrels and Cape Petrels. </p>\n<p>Tonight,  you are invited to attend a special Welcome Aboard cocktail party hosted by the  Captain, who will introduce his senior officers and various members of the <em>Silver Cloud</em> crew.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 — New Island and West Point Island,  Falkland Islands</strong><br />\n  Today  you have two opportunities to enjoy the remarkable beauty of the remote  Falkland Islands. <br />\n  During  the morning we will visit New Island, a wildlife and nature reserve. The New  Island Conservation Trust, a private environmental conservation group, protects  its many birds and animals. Our Zodiacs will take us ashore near the island’s small  settlement at Coffin Harbour. From there we will hike past the Barnard Memorial  Museum crossing the island from east to west to reach the rocky cliffs and a  rookery where Rockhopper Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags share the same nesting  area. We will also observe Black-browed Albatross going about their daily  routines and may even spot Upland Geese on our hike.<br />\n  Our  onboard Historian might tell us about ‘Barnard’s barn’ — a stone structure once  belonging to an early settler and now a museum, as well as the wreck of <em>Protector III</em> — an old minesweeper used  for seal hunting, now grounded not too far from our landing site.<br />\n  <br />\n  During  lunch <em>Silver Cloud</em> will sail in a  northeasterly direction to West Point Island. Peale’s dolphins and Commerson’s  dolphins with their distinctive black and white markings can often be spotted  as one approaches West Point Island. </p>\n<p>Our Zodiacs  will take us to a jetty from where we will walk slightly less than 2 miles to  Devil’s Nose. Walking across rolling moorland and past gorse we will be  observed by Grass Wrens, Long-tailed Meadowlarks, Falkland Thrushes, Striated  Caracaras and Turkey Vultures, but our goal is to reach colonies of  Black-browed Albatross that nest side-by-side with Rockhopper Penguins. The  winds at Devil’s Nose are usually so strong that the albatross only have to  spread their wings to take off, while the penguins (as their name implies) have  to hop from rock to rock to reach either the shore or their nests.</p>\n<p>Once  back at the farm, the hospitable island owners will invite you to have tea,  coffee and homemade cakes and cookies and are always happy to answer your  questions and share their stories.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Stanley, Falkland Islands</strong><br />\n  Stanley  is the capital of the remote Falkland Islands, and –although Argentine  authorities have repeatedly claimed the islands as part of their country- has a  distinct British ambience. A reminder of the 1982 Falkland Conflict between Britain  and Argentina is the Liberation Memorial.<br />\n  <br />\n  Opt to  take a ‘city tour’ by bus with a local guide or stroll through the charming  streets of this colourful little town, lined with quaint cottages and a variety  of traditional pubs. Visit the 19th-century Anglican cathedral (the  southernmost Anglican cathedral in the world) and wander through the Falkland  Islands Dockyard Museum. For stamp collectors a visit to the Philatelic Bureau  is a must.</p>\n<p>Depending  on local conditions there might be the chance to see Gentoo, Magellanic or King  Penguins. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 5-6 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Cruising  the South Atlantic Ocean for two days will give the Expedition Team a chance to  offer talks about the geology, history and the wildlife that make South Georgia  such an interesting and unique place. As part of the preparation to visit South  Georgia and Antarctica, briefings regarding correct procedures when going  ashore and a thorough inspection of clothing and outdoor gear will take place. <br />\n  <br />\n  On our  approach to South Georgia we will pass Shag Rocks, aptly named because of the  large numbers of South Georgia Shags that frequent these rocks. Black-browed  Albatross, White-chinned Petrels, and prions can also be seen.</p>\n<p>Onboard  diversions may include photography workshops, spa treatments, a workout in the  Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 7-9 — South Georgia</strong><br />\n  We will  have three full days to explore this seldom visited and breathtaking  destination of towering snow-covered mountains, mighty glaciers, and low-lying  grasslands. The island attracts an astounding concentration of wildlife:  Southern fur seals, Southern elephant seals and a variety of albatross species  including Black-browed, Light-mantled Sooty, Grey-headed and the spectacular  Wandering Albatross, plus thousands of King and Macaroni Penguins can all be  found here.<br />\n  <br />\n  South  Georgia is also linked to the early Antarctic explorers. Captain James Cook  stepped ashore in<br />\n  1775,  but perhaps more famous is Sir Ernest Shackleton’s arrival in 1916 following  the sinking of his ship <em>Endurance</em>.  Visit the graves of Shackleton and Frank Wild, as well as the whaling museum at  Grytviken. </p>\n<p>Here are  some of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Cooper Bay</strong><br />\n  • Enjoy  a Zodiac cruise to see Macaroni and Chinstrap Penguins on the rocks and in the  water. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Gold Harbour</strong><br />\n  • A  large King Penguin colony can be found near Bertrab Glacier.<br />\n  • Seals  can be seen sunning on the beaches. </p>\n<p><strong>Grytviken</strong><br />\n  •  Grytviken is a historic whaling station that began its life in 1904. One can  still see the remains of the activity: rusted hulls of long abandoned whaling  and sealing ships, equipment left behind and some of the work areas.<br />\n  • The  former whaling station manager’s house is now a museum. Guests can learn about  past whaling techniques and view various exhibits on exploration and discovery.<br />\n  • See  the burial site of the famous explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. The remains of  his faithful companion Frank Wild have been brought to Grytviken’s cemetery,  too.</p>\n<p><strong>Salisbury Plain</strong><br />\n  • A  favourite breeding ground for hundreds of thousands of King Penguins, it is  amazing to see how they completely cover the beaches and hills.<br />\n  • Apart  from King Penguins, fur seals and Southern elephant seals have taken over the  tussock grass areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 10-11 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  Leaving  South Georgia behind, <em>Silver Cloud</em> will head for the South Shetland Islands and Antarctica. On the way south we  might encounter one of the massive tabular icebergs that tend to break off from  the Larsen Ice Shelf. </p>\n<p>The days  at sea will be used to present further lectures. As we are heading for Elephant  Island, our onboard Historian might talk about Shackleton’s crew members awaiting  their rescue at Point Wild, while our Marine Biologist and Ornithologist will  cover the wildlife to be seen.</p>\n<p>Participate  in other onboard activities, relax in one of the lounges, or peruse an array of  titles and topics in the well-stocked Library. Take a stroll on deck and enjoy  the solitude and splendour of the vast sea and sky.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Elephant Island, South Shetland  Islands</strong><br />\n  Awesome glaciers  and steep cliffs greet us as we approach Elephant Island — so named for its former  abundance of elephant seals. The island is home to several Chinstrap Penguin  rookeries, as well as old moss colonies. Weddell seals and Macaroni Penguins  can also be found here.</p>\n<p>When Sir  Ernest Shackleton’s ship <em>Endurance</em> was crushed in pack ice in the Weddell Sea in late 1915, the crew was eventually  stranded on the island for 135 days. A solitary bronze bust can be seen,  honouring the Chilean pilot Luis Pardo, who took the cutter <em>Yelcho</em> across the Drake Passage to  rescue Shackleton’s men.<br />\n</p>\n<p><strong>Days 13-17 — Antarctic Peninsula</strong><br />\n  While  sailing along the Antarctic Peninsula, every turn can reveal a new and breathtaking  adventure. The pack ice becomes thicker the closer we are moving into Antarctica’s  vast white wilderness. Remote and otherworldly, Antarctica is irresistible for  its spectacular iceberg sculptures and calving glaciers, and for the  possibility of close encounters with marine mammals.</p>\n<p>Watch  for seals sunbathing on slow-moving ice floes and for humpback, Minke, and orca  whales to surface from below the frigid waters. Each day we will attempt Zodiac  departures, and, if conditions permit, we will cruise amidst colourful icebergs  or step ashore to visit a variety of penguin rookeries and perhaps scientific  research stations on complimentary excursions led by our team of natural  history experts.</p>\n<p>A  flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of favourable sea and weather  conditions. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition  Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on weather, ice  conditions and wildlife we may encounter. Here are some of the places we may  visit:</p>\n<p><strong>Antarctic Sound</strong><br />\n  Named  after Nordenskjöld’s ship, this 30 miles long stretch of water at the north end  of the Antarctic Peninsula offers some of the best tabular iceberg  observations.</p>\n<p><strong>Brown Bluff, Tabarin Peninsula (a 2,225-foot  bluff on the Antarctic continent).</strong><br />\n  Brown  Bluff is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent  cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock. Adelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls,  and Cape Petrels use this as a breeding area. Birds such as the all-white Snow  Petrel and skuas might also be seen.<br />\n  <br />\n  As you  explore the area, Weddell seals may be seen basking in the sunlight. If  conditions permit, a hike onto a nearby glacier might be possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Paulet Island</strong><br />\n  As you arrive, the sight of Adelie Penguins  covering the entire island may well amaze you. The island is home to 80-90  thousand Adelies that come here to breed. On a nearby hill, view a large colony  of Blue-eyed Shags. Kelp Gulls and Snowy Sheathbills are amongst the birds that  breed on Paulet Island, and Wilson’s Storm Petrels are regularly seen. Listen  as a member of your Expedition Team tells of Otto Nordenskjöld expedition and  how part of his party over-wintered on the island in 1912. Remnants of their  hut still remain.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Cuverville Island, Errera Channel</strong><br />\n  The  island was discovered during de Gerlache’s <em>Belgica</em> expedition of 1897–99, and was named for a vice-admiral in the French navy. The  large, bare rock areas near the shore provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins,  but the penguins also look for exposed rocks on the slopes. Snow Petrels and  Cape Petrels may be seen, and Wilson’s Storm Petrels nest in the higher scree  of the island.</p>\n<p>Depending  on conditions, a hike towards the top of the island for stunning panoramic  views might be offered. During Zodiac tours, we hope to see hauled-out Weddell  seals.</p>\n<p><strong>Paradise Bay, Antarctic Peninsula</strong><br />\n  The bay  is well named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs. From  the ship, observe Argentina’s “Base Brown”, one of many Antarctic research  stations. Close to the station Gentoo Penguins, Blue-eyed Shags, Antarctic  Terns, Kelp Gulls and skuas have all been seen nesting.</p>\n<p>Depending  on the conditions we can view the wildlife from sea level while cruising in our  Zodiacs or cruise the bay with <em>Silver  Cloud</em>. There’s a good chance you’ll come across a crabeater seal relaxing on  a nearby ice floe, or you might see a Minke whale.</p>\n<p><strong>Port Lockroy, Goudier Island</strong><br />\n  The  British built a listening station on Goudier Island during WWII, which was then  used as a research station in the 1950s. Bransfield House was restored in 1996  and since then has acted as a museum and gift shop. The Antarctic Heritage  Trust operates a post office at the station which is open during summer. <br />\n  Snowy  Sheathbills and Gentoo Penguins roam outside the museum and leopard seals often  patrol the sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Port Foster, Whalers Bay (Deception Island)</strong><br />\n  Deception  Island is an excellent example of a caldera where it is believed that the  volcano’s summit collapsed with one section sinking far enough to allow the sea  to flood the interior. We plan to sail into the caldera through a narrow entrance  called Neptune’s Bellows and anchor in sight of the former whaling station and  the former British Antarctic Survey station.</p>\n<p>Our  resident Geologist will take the opportunity to explain the unique volcanic  features of the area and their importance for science, while our Historian  might introduce you to the whaling history of Deception Island. Still visible  on the island are the boilers used to make whale oil in the early 1900s. </p>\n<p>Conditions  permitting, we might hike to Neptune’s Window for spectacular panoramic views.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 18-19 — Drake Passage</strong><br />\n  The  Drake Passage has a notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to the funnelling  effect of the mountain ridges and seafloor pushing winds and water eastwards.  When <em>Silver Cloud</em> reaches the Antarctic  Convergence, a fluid and fluctuating natural boundary where cold polar waters from  the south meet warmer water moving southward, there is another good chance to  see whales and seabirds as nutrients are pushed to the surface by the different  currents<br />\n  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  Spend  some time on deck watching Black-browed Albatross, Southern Giant Petrels,  Southern Fulmars, Cape Petrels and other seabirds gliding in the air currents  of <em>Silver Cloud’s</em> wake.</p>\n<p>There  will be opportunities to attend additional presentations offered by the Expedition  Team lecturers, to edit the countless photos taken and to socialize with new  friends as we travel north towards Ushuaia.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 20 — Ushuaia, Argentina</strong><br />\n  After  breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Cloud</em> and  transfer to Ushuaia International Airport for your return flight to Buenos  Aires.</p>",

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Ushuaia, Argentina</b></p><p>After arrival in Ushuaia embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Cloud</i>, settle in and attend a mandatory safety drill before leaving port. During the afternoon you will be introduced to some of the important crew members and your Expedition Team. At sail away bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego, the ‘Land at the End of the World’.</p><p><b>Days 2–3 — Drake Passage</b></p><p>As we set sail on our initial transit, familiarise yourself with the elegant Silver Cloud and the Expedition Team members. Attend wildlife, geography and history discussions hosted by our expert naturalists and guest lecturers preparing you for the exciting adventures that lie ahead.</p><p>The Drake Passage has a notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to the westerly winds and the funnelling effect of the passage. With modern navigational aids and stabilizers&nbsp;<i>Silver Cloud</i>&nbsp;will bring you safely across these southern waters.</p><p>The Antarctic Convergence is a natural boundary within the Drake Passage where cold polar water and warmer equatorial water come together. When these two currents meet, nutrients are pushed to the surface, often attracting a multitude of seabirds and whales. Spend some time on deck watching the horizon and the variety of seabirds that glide in the air currents of our ship’s wake -such as the Black-browed Albatross, Cape Petrels, White-chinned Petrels and Sooty Shearwaters.</p><p><b>Days 4–8 — Antarctic Peninsula</b></p><p>While sailing in Antarctica’s vast white wilderness, a flexible itinerary will allow us to take advantage of favourable sea and weather conditions. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter.</p><p>Here are some of the places we may visit:</p><p><b>Aitcho Islands, South Shetland Islands&nbsp;</b>(just off the Antarctic Peninsula at the entrance to the English Strait)</p><p>After you step off the Zodiac to explore the island, you will be guided to Gentoo and Chinstrap Penguin colonies. Southern Giant Petrels and skuas are also present. Elephant seals quite often look for company near the landing site, and while heading back to the ship, you may see a leopard seal hunting penguins.</p><p><b>Brown Bluff, Tabarin Peninsula</b>&nbsp;(a 2,200-foot bluff on the Antarctic continent)</p><p>Brown Bluff is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock.</p><p>Adelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels use the base of Brown Bluff as a breeding area. Birds such as the all-white Snow Petrel and skuas may be seen from a distance. Weddell seals may be seen basking in the sunlight near the base of a glacier.</p><p><b>Paulet Island</b></p><p>The sight of Adelie Penguins covering the entire island is quite amazing. The island is home to 80-90 thousand Adelies that come here to breed. On a nearby hill is a massive colony of Blue-eyed Shags. Kelp Gulls and Snowy Sheathbills are amongst the birds that also breed on Paulet Island, and Wilson’s Storm-petrels are regularly seen.</p><p>Members of a Swedish Antarctic expedition had to over-winter on the island in 1912 after their ship was ship-wrecked. Remnants of their hut still remain and you will have to walk past the hut on your way to the islands lake.</p><p><b>Cuverville Island, Errera Channel</b></p><p>The island was discovered by Gerlache’s Belgian Antarctic expedition of 1897–99, and was named for a vice admiral in the French navy. Large, bare rock areas provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins. Snow Petrels and Cape Petrels also may be seen, whilst Wilson’s Storm-petrels nest in the higher scree of the island.</p><p>During Zodiac tours, hauled-out Weddell and Antarctic fur seals are quite often encountered.</p><p><b>Paradise Bay&nbsp;</b>(on the Antarctic Peninsula)</p><p>The bay is well named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs. The Silver Cloud will reach Argentina’s “Base Almirante Brown”, one of many Antarctic research stations. Here, you will actually set foot on the mainland of Antarctica.</p><p>You can also view the wildlife from sea level while cruising in our Zodiacs. Apart from observing nesting cormorants in the cliffs there is a good chance to see crabeater seals relaxing on ice floes, and you might even locate Minke whales.</p><p><b>Petermann Island, Wilhelm Archipelago</b></p><p>The island is named for German geographer August Petermann and was first discovered by a German expedition in 1873-74.</p><p>During our landing, we will be able to observe rookeries of Adelie Penguins, Gentoo Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags. Our onboard Geologist might take the opportunity to point out various geological features and especially where rock surfaces show glacial polish and some glacial grooving.</p><p><b>Pleneau Island, Wilhelm Archipelago</b></p><p>Pleneau Island lies at the south end of the Lemaire Channel, and was first explored during Charcot’s 1903–05 French Antarctic Expedition. The island was named for the expedition’s photographer, Paul Pleneau.</p><p>Amongst the common breeding birds are Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls and South Polar Skuas. Southern elephant seals are often hauled-out in wallows. Enjoy the spectacular scenery of icebergs nearby.</p><p><b>Port Foster, Whalers Bay (Deception Island)</b></p><p>Deception Island is an excellent example of a caldera that can be reached from the sea. We plan to sail inside the caldera through a narrow entrance called Neptune’s Bellows.</p><p>Our Geologist might take the opportunity to explain the unique volcanic features of the area, while our Historian will introduce you to Deception Island’s interesting history -from whaling to scientific studies.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Ushuaia, Argentina</b></p><p>After arrival in Ushuaia embark&nbsp;<i>Silver Cloud</i>, settle in and attend a mandatory safety drill before leaving port. During the afternoon you will be introduced to some of the important crew members and your Expedition Team. At sail away bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego, the ‘Land at the End of the World’.</p><p><b>Days 2–3 — Drake Passage</b></p><p>As we set sail on our initial transit, familiarise yourself with the elegant Silver Cloud and the Expedition Team members. Attend wildlife, geography and history discussions hosted by our expert naturalists and guest lecturers preparing you for the exciting adventures that lie ahead.</p><p>The Drake Passage has a notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to the westerly winds and the funnelling effect of the passage. With modern navigational aids and stabilizers&nbsp;<i>Silver Cloud</i>&nbsp;will bring you safely across these southern waters.</p><p>The Antarctic Convergence is a natural boundary within the Drake Passage where cold polar water and warmer equatorial water come together. When these two currents meet, nutrients are pushed to the surface, often attracting a multitude of seabirds and whales. Spend some time on deck watching the horizon and the variety of seabirds that glide in the air currents of our ship’s wake -such as the Black-browed Albatross, Cape Petrels, White-chinned Petrels and Sooty Shearwaters.</p><p><b>Days 4–8 — Antarctic Peninsula</b></p><p>While sailing in Antarctica’s vast white wilderness, a flexible itinerary will allow us to take advantage of favourable sea and weather conditions. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter.</p><p>Here are some of the places we may visit:</p><p><b>Aitcho Islands, South Shetland Islands&nbsp;</b>(just off the Antarctic Peninsula at the entrance to the English Strait)</p><p>After you step off the Zodiac to explore the island, you will be guided to Gentoo and Chinstrap Penguin colonies. Southern Giant Petrels and skuas are also present. Elephant seals quite often look for company near the landing site, and while heading back to the ship, you may see a leopard seal hunting penguins.</p><p><b>Brown Bluff, Tabarin Peninsula</b>&nbsp;(a 2,200-foot bluff on the Antarctic continent)</p><p>Brown Bluff is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock.</p><p>Adelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels use the base of Brown Bluff as a breeding area. Birds such as the all-white Snow Petrel and skuas may be seen from a distance. Weddell seals may be seen basking in the sunlight near the base of a glacier.</p><p><b>Paulet Island</b></p><p>The sight of Adelie Penguins covering the entire island is quite amazing. The island is home to 80-90 thousand Adelies that come here to breed. On a nearby hill is a massive colony of Blue-eyed Shags. Kelp Gulls and Snowy Sheathbills are amongst the birds that also breed on Paulet Island, and Wilson’s Storm-petrels are regularly seen.</p><p>Members of a Swedish Antarctic expedition had to over-winter on the island in 1912 after their ship was ship-wrecked. Remnants of their hut still remain and you will have to walk past the hut on your way to the islands lake.</p><p><b>Cuverville Island, Errera Channel</b></p><p>The island was discovered by Gerlache’s Belgian Antarctic expedition of 1897–99, and was named for a vice admiral in the French navy. Large, bare rock areas provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins. Snow Petrels and Cape Petrels also may be seen, whilst Wilson’s Storm-petrels nest in the higher scree of the island.</p><p>During Zodiac tours, hauled-out Weddell and Antarctic fur seals are quite often encountered.</p><p><b>Paradise Bay&nbsp;</b>(on the Antarctic Peninsula)</p><p>The bay is well named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs. The Silver Cloud will reach Argentina’s “Base Almirante Brown”, one of many Antarctic research stations. Here, you will actually set foot on the mainland of Antarctica.</p><p>You can also view the wildlife from sea level while cruising in our Zodiacs. Apart from observing nesting cormorants in the cliffs there is a good chance to see crabeater seals relaxing on ice floes, and you might even locate Minke whales.</p><p><b>Petermann Island, Wilhelm Archipelago</b></p><p>The island is named for German geographer August Petermann and was first discovered by a German expedition in 1873-74.</p><p>During our landing, we will be able to observe rookeries of Adelie Penguins, Gentoo Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags. Our onboard Geologist might take the opportunity to point out various geological features and especially where rock surfaces show glacial polish and some glacial grooving.</p><p><b>Pleneau Island, Wilhelm Archipelago</b></p><p>Pleneau Island lies at the south end of the Lemaire Channel, and was first explored during Charcot’s 1903–05 French Antarctic Expedition. The island was named for the expedition’s photographer, Paul Pleneau.</p><p>Amongst the common breeding birds are Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls and South Polar Skuas. Southern elephant seals are often hauled-out in wallows. Enjoy the spectacular scenery of icebergs nearby.</p><p><b>Port Foster, Whalers Bay (Deception Island)</b></p><p>Deception Island is an excellent example of a caldera that can be reached from the sea. We plan to sail inside the caldera through a narrow entrance called Neptune’s Bellows.</p><p>Our Geologist might take the opportunity to explain the unique volcanic features of the area, while our Historian will introduce you to Deception Island’s interesting history -from whaling to scientific studies.

Take this opportunity to attend additional presentations offered by the Expedition Team lecturers and to edit the many photos taken as we travel towards Ushuaia.</p><p><b>Day 11 — Ushuaia, Argentina</b></p><p>After breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<i>Silver Cloud.</i></p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Ushuaia, Argentina</b></p><p>Embark <i>Silver Cloud</i> and meet some of your fellow travellers as you become acquainted with the luxurious amenities found on board. After settling in a mandatory safety drill will have to be attended. Later your Expedition Leader will introduce some of the important crew members and your Expedition Team. While we sail out of Ushuaia you will be able to see the many snow-covered mountains lining the Beagle Channel and bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego. Enjoy the spectacular scenery while we have our sail away cocktail on the open decks.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 2 — At Sea</b>\n</p><p>Gather in the Theatre Lounge to hear fascinating tales of adventure and to learn about the Falkland’s endemic wildlife and remarkable nature. Our knowledgeable Lecture Staff members are experts in a variety of scientific fields. Other onboard diversions include spa treatments, a workout in the Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 3 —   Steeple Jason Island, Falkland Islands </b></p><p><b>\n\tWest Point Island, Falkland Islands</b>\n</p><p>Steeple Jason was used for sheep-grazing until the 1980s, but never properly inhabited; therefore birdlife has been less disturbed and includes Southern Rockhopper Penguins, Magellanic Penguins, Gentoo Penguins, Slender-billed Prions, caracaras and Blackish Cinclodes (known locally as Tussac-Birds), as well as Black-browed Albatrosses. Roughly 70% of the world’s population of Black-browed Albatrosses is said the breed on the Falkland Islands and Steeple Jason has the largest colony. The Steinhart Station, a field research station, was built on Steeple Jason in 2003 to monitor wildlife. Sea lions and fur seals can be seen along the shore.\n</p><p>\t\nIn the afternoon, watch for Peale’s dolphins and the distinctive black and white markings of the Commerson’s dolphin as the <i>Silver Cloud </i>approaches West Point Island. Upon arrival, photographic opportunities are everywhere as you walk across rolling moorland and admire colonies of Black-browed Albatrosses that nest side-by-side with Rockhopper Penguins. Learn about the island’s unique vegetation. The hospitable island owners are always happy to answer your questions and share their stories.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 4 — Stanley, Falkland Islands</b>\n</p><p>Stanley has a distinct British ambience and we begin our day in the capital city of the remote Falkland Islands by boarding a local bus for a ‘city tour’ with a local guide. You can also stroll through the charming streets of this colourful little town, lined with quaint cottages and a variety of traditional pubs. Visit the 19th-century Anglican cathedral (the southernmost Anglican cathedral in the world) and wander through the Falkland Islands Dockyard Museum. For stamp collectors a visit to the Philatelic Bureau is a must. Walking along Ross Road you will come to a monument to honour the victims of the 1982 Falklands War between Britain and Argentina.\n</p><p>\n<b>Days 5–6 — At Sea</b>\n</p><p>Binoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to watch for seabirds and whales. Attend informative lectures that will prepare you for the upcoming visits in South Georgia and the adventures that lie ahead. Peruse an array of titles and topics in the well-stocked Library, enjoy the finest cigars and cognacs at the Connoisseur’s Corner or indulge in any of the other special amenities offered aboard ship. </p><p>\n\n<b>Days 6–10 — South Georgia</b>\n</p><p>This breathtaking destination of towering snow-covered mountains, mighty glaciers, and low-lying grasslands attracts an astounding concentration of wildlife: Southern fur seals, Southern elephant seals and a variety of albatross species including Black-browed, Light-mantled Sooty, Grey-headed and the spectacular Wandering Albatross, plus thousands of King and hundreds of Macaroni Penguins.\n</p><p>\nSouth Georgia is also linked to the early Antarctic explorers. Captain James Cook first stepped ashore in 1775, but perhaps more famous is Ernest Shackleton’s arrival in 1916 following the sinking of his ship Endurance. Visit Shackleton’s and Frank Wild’s grave and the whaling museum at Grytviken. </p><p>\n\nHere are some of the places we may visit:</p><p>\n\n<b>Cooper Bay</b> </p><p>\n-Go ashore by Zodiac to see numerous breeds of penguins, such as Macaroni and Chinstrap, on the rocks and waters surrounding the island.\n\n</p><p><b>Gold Harbour</b>\n</p><p>-A large King Penguin colony can be found near Bertrab Glacier.\n</p><p>-Seals can be seen resting on ice floes and sunning on the beaches.\n</p><p>\n<b>Grytviken</b>\n</p><p>-A historic whaling station, all that remains today are the rusted hulls of long abandoned whalers and working sheds. </p><p>\n-At the South Georgia Museum guests can learn about past whaling techniques and view various exhibits on exploration and discovery.\n</p><p>-At the burial site of the famous explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton we will toast the great explorer.\n</p><p>\n<b>Salisbury Plain</b>\n</p><p>-A favourite breeding ground for hundreds of thousands of King Penguins; it is amazing to see how they completely cover the beaches and hills.\n</p><p>-In early March, the seal pups will be quite active and aggressive.\n</p><p>\n<b>Days 11–13 — At Sea</b>\n</p><p>As we cross the South Atlantic, leisurely days at sea are yours to enjoy. Participate in discussions and onboard activities led by the Expedition Team, relax in one of the lounges with that book you have been meaning to read, and meet up with new friends for cocktails. Before turning in for the night, take a stroll on deck to take in the solitude of the vast sea and sky.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day&nbsp;14 — Gough Island, UK (Subject to government approval)</b>\n</p><p>A dependency of Tristan da Cunha and part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, Gough Island was originally known as Gonçalo Álvares (the captain of Vasco da Gama’s flagship). The volcanic island covers an area of 91 km² and is uninhabited except for the personnel of a South African weather station (usually six people).  It is one of the most remote places with a constant human presence.\n\n</p><p>Gough Island is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gough and Inaccessible Islands, a protected wildlife reserve and an “Important Bird Area”.  If conditions allow we will offer a Zodiac cruise and look for Tristan Albatross, Atlantic Petrel, Gough Moorhen, Gough Bunting, and Northern Rockhopper Penguins -some of the many birds using this mid-Atlantic island as their nesting ground.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day&nbsp;15 — Tristan da Cunha, UK</b>\n</p><p>Recognised as the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, its closest neighbouring landmass is the island of St. Helena some 2,430 km away. The main island is home to 301 hardy residents (census March 2016). \n\n</p><p>Weather and landing depending, we hope to enjoy guided walks with the local inhabitants of the village while our onboard Geologist will lead a walk to the 1961 volcanic cone and lava flow. Learn how the islanders were evacuated and how it affected their lives.  Once at the top, we will have a beautiful scenic view of the whole settlement – a photo opportunity not to be missed. We will meet with some of the island children and hear what Tristan life is like through their eyes during our visit to St Mary’s School.  Our onboard Ornithologist will point out birdlife, hopefully including the Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross, Sooty Albatross, Tristan Thrush, and Tristan Wandering Albatross – a critically endangered species with fewer than 1,500 breeding pairs left in the world. The archipelago is also where 90% of the world’s Northern Rockhopper Penguins come to breed. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day&nbsp;16 — Nightingale Island, UK</b>\n</p><p>Weather permitting; we hope to land on the uninhabited Nightingale Island, a protected wildlife reserve and World Heritage Site. You will see the most magnificent wildlife, flora and fauna all unspoilt by people. All guests will receive a certificate verifying that they have indeed visited this extremely remote world destination.\n</p><p>\n<b>Days 17–20 — At Sea</b>\n</p><p>Enjoy a variety of onboard activities. Our days at sea are filled with educational lectures and interesting entertainment options. All accommodations feature an interactive television system allowing you to watch your choice of movies or documentary films and even recorded broadcasts from the Theatre Lounge in the comfort and privacy of your suite.\nOn the last day your onboard Videographer will screen his Voyage-DVD, letting you remember all those special moments during your voyage.\n</p><p>\nThe Captain will invite you to his (your) Farewell Cocktail Party and the Chef and Restaurant Manager want to surprise you with the special Farewell Dinner. </p><p>\n\n<b>Days 21–22 — Cape Town, South Africa</b>\n</p><p>Arriving in the morning of Day 21 (20 March) you will be able to explore the natural wonders of Cape Town.  You can choose to ascend Table Mountain by cable car and hike in the protected area, having a look at the many endemic plants and animals. Later you will travel by bus to Signal Hill for dramatic views over Table Bay and Cape Town.  Or you can go on an excursion to see an African Penguin colony at Boulders Beach. The scenic drive to Boulders Beach will go along the Atlantic seaboard and later will continue through the prestigious suburbs of Bishopscourt and Constantia into the region where South Africa’s wine industry began over 3 centuries ago. At one of the local wine estates you will enjoy a formal wine tasting (paired with canapés). \n\nIn the evening you are free to enjoy the unique opportunity to explore the vibrant V &amp; A Waterfront in Cape Town Harbour on your own. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day&nbsp;22 — Cape Town, South Africa</b>\t\n</p><p>After breakfast on Wednesday, 21 March, disembark <i>Silver Cloud. </i></p><p><i>\n\nExpedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

In 1908, a sparkling diamond was found among the sand and the news spread like wildfire, causing fortune hunters to converge in droves on Kolmanskop. When the town reached its pinnacle Kolmanskop developed into a lively little haven of German culture. However, richer diamond deposits were discovered further south, and operations were moved. Today it is mostly a ghost town; the stately homes, eroded by the wind, are gradually becoming sand-covered. However, a museum has been established and a number of buildings restored. While in Kolmanskop enjoy oyster tasting and a glass of sparkling wine. \nOur excursion continues with a visit of Lüderitz and its three most important landmarks: Goerke Haus, Felsenkirche and the Luderitz Museum.\n</p><p><b>DAYS 4–5 — WALVIS BAY, NAMIBIA</b></p><p><b> \n\nSCENIC DUNES FLIGHT</b></p><p>\nTake advantage of an unparalleled opportunity to see the famous Sossusvlei Dunes from the air, a site very difficult to access by land. Following the (normally dry) Kuiseb River, fly over Sesriem Canyon then along the Tsauchab river valley where the freestanding but static dunes tower up to 250 metres above the plain. The dune belt runs north to south for over 70 km between Sossusvlei and the Atlantic. Upon reaching the coast, head north over deserted mining camps and seal colonies to Conception Bay and the wreck of the Eduard Bohlen (run aground in the early 40s). This optional Silver Shore excursion will operate only if weather/fog conditions permit. Please contact Reservations to add this excursion to your booking.\n</p><p>Your destination is the Namib Naukluft Park in discovery of the treasures of the Namib. On the way you will pass by endless waves of sand dunes, and when you think of Africa and the desert, this is the scene that comes to mind. Entering the Namib Naukluft National Park and turning onto the Welwitschia Drive, the landscape becomes dotted with the extraordinary Welwitschia mirabilis plant. Unique to the Namibe Desert, these prehistoric plants have adapted to their harsh habitat. Welwitschias only produce two leaves in their lifetime and have a lifespan of over 500 years. After stopping to view and discuss these amazing and resilient desert plants in their dramatic landscape, the tour continues to the ‘lunar landscape’. In this vast area of eroded valleys, you can almost imagine you are on the moon. This is where different species of lichen grow. Enjoy the breathtaking views, before driving onwards to a local community where you will enjoy an orientation tour of a local school, having the opportunity to interact by giving some of your time to the children and community. </p><p>\n\nYou will then drive to a pristine location where refreshments await you before returning to Walvis Bay to rejoin the <i>Silver Cloud.</i>\n</p><p>\nWe will also be operating a full day shuttle service to Swakopmund, located 19 miles north of Walvis Bay at the mouth of the Swakop River. Upon arrival you can explore this quaint town on your own.  Swakopmund is a beach resort area and a fine example of German colonial architecture. Founded in 1892 as the main harbor for German South-West Africa, a good part of the population still speaks German today. The Magistrate’s Court, or Kaiserliches Bezirksgericht, the Lutheran Church and the old Railway Station building -now the main reception area of the Swakopmund Hotel- will give an idea of the former splendor.\n</p><p>We begin our second day in Walvis Bay with an early morning boat cruise in the protected outer lagoon area where the water is calm and abundant with bird life. Enjoy wonderful photographic opportunities as playful Heaviside’s and bottlenose dolphins frolic in the boat’s bow wave and wake and pelicans fly low overhead. Atlantic cape fur seals may even come aboard for a fishy snack! Other birds we will see include flamingos and cormorants. If we are very lucky, we may even see leatherback turtles, whales, or the local ‘Mola Mola’ or sunfish. We will pass fishing factories and foreign ships in the port and conclude our excursion with a taste of fresh Walvis Bay oysters and local ‘champagne’.\n</p><p><b>DAY 6 — AT SEA</b>\n</p><p>Binoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to watch for seabirds and marine mammals. Attend informative lectures that will prepare you for the upcoming ports-of-call and the adventures that lie ahead. Other onboard diversions include spa treatments, a workout in the Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences.\n</p><p><b>DAY 7 — NAMIBE, ANGOLA</b>\n</p><p>Today we will head out to the Namibe Desert. Apart from looking for Welwitschia mirabilis, an endemic plant found in the Namibe Provence of South Angola and the Namib Desert, the tour will continue through the desert landscape to The Arch Lagoon, also known as “the lost oasis”. The lagoon, locally known as “Lago do Arco do Carvalhao”, will only have water if Angola has had an excellent rainy season. It is formed by a magnificent rock formation, and is a unique display of art in nature. If it has rained it will be inhabited by an abundance of birdlife. Before returning to the ship, we will visit the little town of Namibe to visit the old city with its baroque architecture, old stadium and churches.\n</p><p><b>DAY 8 — LOBITO, ANGOLA</b>\n</p><p>The city of Benguela was founded in 1617 around Sao Filipe Fortress and was one of the bases for Portuguese expansion in Africa. We will visit the Ethnographic Museum before driving through the city to the most famous church in Benguela. The “Igreja do Populo” is over 100 years old, and was built by the Portuguese during the colonial era, being the first stone building in southern Angola. From there we will walk to the heart of Benguela City, where the courthouse surrounds the company gardens, the Department of Justice and the Town Hall. The gardens are lined with beautiful palm trees and flowers and offer a very picturesque setting. </p><p>\nEn route back to Lobito we will stop at the city of Catumbela and will stop at Sao Pedro fort for some photos, and will see the big Catumbela River and the 1905 steel bridge, from Eiffel’s engineering company, which was in use until 2010.\n</p><p>Once back at the pier there will be a festival with traditional dances and singing.</p><p> \n<b>DAY 9 — LUANDA, ANGOLA</b>\n</p><p>Luanda is the capital of Angola, and home to more than four million -making it the third-largest Portuguese speaking city in the world. </p><p>\nThis bustling city presents us with many places to explore, including the 1575 Fortress of San Miguel de Luanda with its striking blue tiles and its Museum of the Armed Forces. We will drive to Cidade Alta, or “Uptown” —a pleasant, airy and calm suburb with several pink colonial buildings and then head to the Baixa, or “Downtown”, to view the Houses of Parliament — both new and old. Afterwards we drive to the Agostinho Neto Mausoleum before returning to the pier and ship.\n</p><p><b>DAYS 10-12 — AT SEA</b></p><p>\nLeaving the coast of Angola behind, Silver Cloud will head towards the mid-Atlantic Ridge and St Helena, one of the least-visited places on Earth. While the ship has to cover almost 1200 nautical miles, our lecturers will present interesting topic, seminars and workshops. You can also head out on deck helping our Ornithologist to watch for seabirds and our Marine Biologist looking for marine mammals. Other onboard diversions include the Spa and Gym, plus there are always moments to savour the different culinary specialities prepared by our Executive Chef and his team. </p><p>\n<b>DAYS 13-14 — JAMESTOWN, ST HELENA, UK</b>\n</p><p>For over 500 years St Helena has been an important strategic point for European ventures into the southern hemisphere and the East India Company had the Plantation House built for the island’s governor in 1792. But St Helena is invariably linked with the French Emperor Napoleon. He was exiled on St Helena from 1815 until he died in 1821. The Napoleonic properties –Longwood House, the Briars Pavilion and Napoleon’s Tomb- can all be visited. Other earlier illustrious visits were by astronomers Edmund Halley in 1673 and Dr. Neville Maskelyne in 1760. St James Church, the oldest Anglican church in the southern hemisphere dates from 1774. Superb views across the island can be had from High Knoll Fort, which was started in 1798 and improved in 1874.\n</p><p>For the adventurous and fit Jacobs Ladder could be of interest: the ladder actually is an inclined plane with 699 steps (and 600ft). For connoisseurs a visit to the St Helena Distillery is a must: names like White Lion Rum, Midnight Mist coffee liqueur and Juniper flavoured gin entice to see how they are made –and perhaps taste them.\n</p><p>With our Expedition Team and local experts we will cover as many aspects of this remote island as possible. </p><p>\n<b>DAYS 15-16 — AT SEA</b>\n</p><p>The second long leg of our voyage follows the mid-Atlantic Ridge to reach another rarely visited island: Ascension. Our lecturers will present talks about the importance of this isolated island in modern history and will present the natural history of this part of the Atlantic.\n</p><p><b>DAY 17 — GEORGETOWN, ASCENSION ISLAND, UK</b>\n</p><p>700 nautical miles northwest of St Helena, Ascension was used as a garrison in 1815 to ensure that the French would not try to rescue Napoleon from his exile on St Helena. Today we will visit Georgetown, the island’s main settlement. Some 900 residents can be found on the island of 88 square kilometres. Although there are some beaches not all of them are suitable for swimming. Sea turtles do come to nest at this isolated outpost, and the lush highlands invite to do some hiking. Surprisingly this forest was introduced to the island in the mid-19th century as a means to improve gardening- it now is a national park. The island has served as a naval station and in the 20th century was first used by the American air force and is still being used by the British air force. The island and surrounding rocks are an Important Bird Area and Red-billed Tropicbirds, Ascension Frigatebirds, as well as Sooty Terns, White Terns, Brown Noddies and Black Noddies nest.\n</p><p><b>DAYS 18-19 — AT SEA</b>\n</p><p>Having left Ascension behind, Silver Cloud will be on her way to once again reach the coast of Africa. 1000 nautical miles separate Ascension from Abidjan and this last sea leg will permit you to edit the photos you have taken so far, to attend talks by our experts, to relax at the pool and to enjoy the many culinary highlights prepared by our chefs.\n</p><p><b>DAY 20 — ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST</b>\n</p><p>Today we will drive to the village Songon Kassemblé located approximately 25 kilometres from Abidjan. Upon arrival, we will be received by the Ebrié traditional chief and his staff. After meeting with the Ebrié community, visiting their village and the camp Petit Zuenoula we will witness a Zaouli traditional Dance.  See how the local food Attiéké is made from cassava.\n</p><p> \t\nLater we drive to the old Colonial capital city of Grand-Bassam (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) where we will have buffet lunch by the sea before visiting the French colonial district, the costume museum; the craft center; the governor “Binger” Palace, and the Arianne Monument reminding the yellow fever epidemic disease during the colonial period. Visit the reputed market for souvenirs shopping.\n</p><p>\n<b>DAY 21 — TAKORADI, GHANA</b>\n</p><p>This morning we set out to explore the Gold Coast area.\n</p><p>We drive to Elmina Village where we will tour Elmina Castle, which was built in 1482 and is said to be one of the oldest European-built structure south of the Sahara. Between the picturesque old town alleys and the numerous flat-bottomed pirogue boats in the harbour, we enjoy one of West Africa’s greatest photo opportunities. We continue to the notorious Cape Coast Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage site. First built in 1653 for the trade in timber and gold, the Castle was later used in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. We will visit the museum and view the dungeons that once held hundreds of men and women as they awaited deportation across the Atlantic as slaves. </p><p>\nAlternatively, travel inland to visit the Kakum National Park, a 357-square-km park comprising undisturbed virgin rainforest. Join our natural history staff and local guides for a walking tour through the forest and on a canopy walkway, offering an opportunity to see much of Ghana’s indigenous plant life, as well as rare butterflies, birds and game. Following each morning tour, we will enjoy lunch at a nearby beach resort before returning to Takoradi and sailing to Tema.\n</p><p><b>DAY 22 — TEMA, GHANA</b>\n</p><p>This morning disembark <i>Silver Cloud</i> after breakfast.\n</p><p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Accra, Ghana</b>\n</p><p>Embark <i>Silver Cloud</i> for your 16-day Silversea Expedition. Once on board, become acquainted with the ship’s luxurious amenities. A mandatory safety drill will take place before we leave port. During sail away meet some of your fellow explorers. This evening, after settling in and having set sail, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 2 — Takoradi, Ghana</b>\n</p><p>This morning we set out to explore the Gold Coast area. We drive to Elmina Village where we will tour Elmina Castle, which was built in 1482 and is one of the oldest European-built structures outside of Europe. Between the picturesque old town alleys and the numerous flat-bottomed pirogue boats in the harbour, we enjoy one of West Africa’s greatest photo opportunities. </p><p>\n\nWe continue to the notorious Cape Coast Castle which was built in 1653 for the trade in timber and gold. The Castle was later used in the trans-Atlantic slave trade and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site today. We will visit the museum and view the dungeons that once held hundreds of men and women as they awaited deportation across the Atlantic as slaves.\n</p><p> \t\nAlternatively, travel inland to visit the Kakum National Park, a 357-square-km park comprising undisturbed virgin rainforest. Join our natural history staff and local guides for a walking tour through the forest and on a canopy walkway, offering an opportunity to see much of Ghana’s indigenous plant life, as well as rare butterflies, birds and game. \n\n</p><p><b>Day 3 — Abidjan, Ivory Coast</b>\n</p><p>Despite the fact that Yamoussoukro is Ivory Coast’s capital, the city of Abidjan with its port still is the commercial centre of the country. Our morning excursion will take us to see some of Abidjan’s highlights –like the modernistic St. Paul’s Cathedral (one of Africa’s largest cathedrals) and the National Museum. We will also drive to the historic town of Grand-Bassam, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was the first capital of the country and was chosen by UNESCO as an example of a late 19th- and early 20th-century colonial town planned for Europeans and Africans.</p><p> \n\t\nIf conditions permit we will try to get to the “Parc National Iles Ehotilé” east of Abidjan. This area encompasses 6 islands in a large lagoon fed by several mayor rivers. It was declared a RAMSAR site in 2005. Some 128 species of birds have been recorded. One of the islands has thousands of straw–coloured fruit bats which the local population sees as a sign of their ancestor’s presence. \n\n</p><p><b>Day 4 — At Sea</b>\n</p><p>Our knowledgeable Lecture Staff members are experts in a variety of scientific fields and will keep you informed with entertaining and fascinating lectures about the European exploration and native cultures and wildlife. Attend a photography workshop and let the Executive Chef show you how special delicacies are prepared on board. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 5 — Tokeh, Sierra Leone</b>\n</p><p>While we spend the morning at sea, our lecturers will be able to present topics relevant to 
Sierra Leone and other small West African countries.\n</p><p>\nOur first glimpse of Sierra Leone will be the area south of Freetown. Once the ship has been cleared into the country, we will be able to go ashore by special permission and spend the afternoon at the foot of the Western Area National Park and the private beach of Tokeh. The use is exclusively for Silversea guests and we will have a cultural performance to welcome us into the country. In the evening we will have local meals on the beach.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 6 — Freetown, Sierra Leone</b> </p><p>\nWe arrive early in the morning in the bustling West African city of Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone. In 1787, British philanthropists founded the ‘Province of Freedom’, which later became Freetown, a British crown colony and the principal base for the suppression of the slave trade. By 1792, 1,200 freed slaves from Nova Scotia had joined the original settlers, the Maroons. Another group of slaves rebelled in Jamaica and travelled to Freetown in 1800.\n</p><p>\t\nDuring our tour we anticipate visiting a local community clinic where we will see the work of volunteers and the Greatest Goal Ministries, a US non-profit organisation. In addition, we hope to attend a soccer match arranged by the Greatest Goal Ministries, played on the beach near Lumley. All soccer team members were affected by the horrible civil war and have lost one or both of their legs and form part of an amazing amputee soccer club! Sierra Leone is a member of the World Amputee Football Association and our presence will help promote self-esteem and self-confidence of the participants.\n</p><p>\nWe might also visit the Western Area Forest Reserve (accepted by UNESCO as a tentative World heritage Site) to see the Tacaguma Chimpanzee Sanctuary, south of Freetown and close to the Congo Dam, to learn more about these primates and their struggle to survive in a country where the bush meat trade is still a very serious problem. </p><p>\n\t\n<b>Day 7 — At Sea</b> </p><p>\nBinoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to watch for seabirds and marine mammals. Attend informative lectures that will prepare you for our visit to The Gambia. Peruse an array of titles and topics in the well-stocked Library, enjoy the finest cigars and cognacs at the Connoisseur’s Corner or indulge in any of the other special amenities offered aboard ship. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 8 — Banjul, The Gambia</b> </p><p>\nThe Gambia is quite a unique country: the English-speaking country is surrounded by French-speaking Senegal and runs parallel to the Gambia River on both sides. The European history started with a Baltic German intent of colonization in the mid-17th century.\n</p><p>\nOur drive through Banjul will take us to the National Museum where we will see displays of historical and cultural artefacts, including musical instruments. A visit to Banjul’s main urban market –Royal Albert Market- will show the typical hustle and bustle of a lively market offering a large selection of nearly everything you expect, including wooden masks.\n</p><p>\nOrnithologists all over the world consider The Gambia to be a birdwatchers’ paradise where over 500 species can be seen. This morning we head to the Tanji Bird Reserve where our guides lead us on a forest walk. The reserve is an important stop for European migrants and more than 250 bird species live in the reserve, which includes the Bijol Islands.\n</p><p>  \nAlternatively, visit the Makasutu cultural forest situated on the banks of a beautiful meandering tributary of the River Gambia, and encompassing many different ecosystems including dense forest, savannah and mangrove regions. The forest is home to hundreds of varieties of birds, three species of monkeys, monitor lizards, pygmy deer, and mongoose.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 9 — Dakar, Senegal</b> </p><p> \nEntering the harbour of Dakar Silver Cloud will pass later Goree Island. Located just off the coast of Dakar it will be one of our next destinations. </p><p>\n\nJust off Dakar’s western shore is the small group Îles de la Madeleine. Not only is this group a National Park, it has also been placed on the Tentative List as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We intend to do a Zodiac cruise around the islands to see dolphins, sea turtles, and the only colony of Red-Billed Tropicbirds known in Africa. Permission pending, we might even land for some hikes.\n</p><p>\nThis small island Goree is notable in history as a major centre in the slave trade and has been recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Our primary focus will be the Maison des Esclaves (House of Slaves) built by the Dutch in 1776 as a holding point for slaves. Now a museum, we will tour through the dungeons where slaves were held, and hear of how they were sold and shipped. Goree also houses the IFAN Historical Museum to learn more about the history of Senegal, the Musee de la Femme (The Women's Museum) to look at the role of Senegalese women in traditional and modern West African culture, and the Maritime Museum to better understand Senegal's seafaring history.\n</p><p>\nA special highlight of the visit will be a lantern lit Senegalese dinner on Goree Island with traditional music as entertainment.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 10 – Joal-Fadiouth and Saly, Senegal</b> \n</p><p><i>Silver Cloud</i> will have headed south during the night to reach Joal-Fadiouth. Joal was once an important trading post in Senegal, today it is Senegal’s most important fishing port. Joal and Fadiouth are connected by a bridge and the specialty of Fadiouth is the use of sea shells in art and construction. Surrounded by an estuary with many small islets and mangroves, some islands are man-made using shells. Even the cemetery is located on one of these sea shell islands and surprisingly has both Muslim and Christian burials close together. </p><p>\n\nSaly is a well-known resort area with nice beaches –just the right place to relax before heading to Morocco and its desert.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 11 – At Sea</b> </p><p>\nLet our lecturers prepare you for a different aspect and face of Africa: the desert and the surprising variety of Morocco. You can also head out on deck to watch for seabirds and marine mammals or attend a seminar.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 12 —Dakhla, Morocco</b>\n</p><p>Dakhla is located at the tip of a thin peninsula and we will head ashore this afternoon to explore and to capture a sense of this area with our cameras. Historically, this was once a Spanish colony named Villa Cisneros and an Old Spanish lighthouse still stands on the outskirts of town. </p><p>\n\nDisembark the ship and depart on 4x4 vehicles across the modern part of Dakhla toward the mainland. We will drive along the Laguna of Dakhla, a paradise for migratory birds, especially flamingos. We will venture into incredible scenery until we reach a Sahraoui camp set up overlooking the Laguna and a beautiful white sand dune.\n</p><p>\nDiscover for a few hours the Sahraoui culture, exclusively nomadic and centred on dromedaries, with a tea ceremony, ride a camel, visit the replica of a Sahraoui family encampment and discover the breath-taking view from the top of the White Dune. 4x4s will be available to go birding from the campsite with the onboard Ornithologist (depending on the tide and bird presence in the area).  There will also be the opportunity to swim in the Laguna.\n</p><p>\nReturn to <i>Silver Cloud</i> with a new appreciation of the remoteness of this region and the nomadic nature of the local culture.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 13 – Laayoune, Morocco</b>\n</p><p>Leaving the <i>Silver Cloud</i> in El Marsa we will drive into the desert to reach the city of Laayoune. Once there, we will start with the dromedary souk and the El Mechouar Square. After viewing the Moulay Abdelaziz mosque from the outside we continue to the artisanal complex known for its silver work. Laayoune started as a Spanish town and still has the Cathedral of Saint Francis of Assisi and a Spanish school. As our final stop in Laayoune we will drive to a lookout point overlooking the dam on the Saquia El Hamra River. During our return we will stop in the desert at a camp exclusively set up for Silversea and will be able to relax with refreshments and special sundowners.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 14 – At Sea</b> </p><p>\nLet our lecturers entertain you with topics related to North Africa and the Sahara. Other onboard diversions include spa treatments, a workout in the Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences.\n\n</p><p><b>Day 15 —Safi, Morocco</b>\n</p><p>Our destination today is exotic Marrakech. The drive from Safi towards the foothills of the snow-capped Atlas Mountains will be quite long, so we intend to visit a Bedouin camp set up almost in the middle of nowhere on our way. Coffee, tea, juices and canapés will break up your journey. </p><p>\n\nOnce we reach Marrakech our local hosts will lead us to a village of tents set up especially for us. The whole surrounding, the delicious food and the music, in short the atmosphere, will have you believe Rudolph Valentino might just be around the corner.\n</p><p>\nAfter lunch will visit the tranquil Majorelle Gardens, designed by the French artist Louis Majorelle with lush greenery, palm trees, cacti, still pools and shady nooks, before strolling through the labyrinth of alleyways in the ancient, 12th century Medina. Not only will we visit the Medersa Ben Youssef, built in 1570 it is the biggest Koran School of the whole Maghreb (West), but will then discover the labyrinth of souks.  You can browse through the antique, spices, textile and carpet shops. The many colourful souks have local and Berber handicrafts in leather, brass, copper, silver, and gold for you. Not only souvenir hunters will have a wonderful time experiencing local life. Our guided tour ends with a visit to the famous Djemâa el Fna Square, where we will find a permanent theatre of musicians, acrobats, snake charmers, food stalls and storytellers -truly out of “1001 Arabian Nights”.\n\n</p><p>After an exciting and eventful day we return to Safi.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 16 – At Sea</b> </p><p>\nDuring our last day of the voyage make use of the Gym or Spa - you will also have time to edit your photos, to attend a lecture or seminar, and to relax.\n</p><p>\nToday the onboard Videographer will show his/her “Voyage-DVD”, reminding you of the many varied impressions you will have had during the last two weeks.\n</p><p>\nThe Captain will invite to his Farewell Cocktail and the Executive Chef will want to surprise you with a special Farewell Dinner.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 17 — Lisbon, Portugal</b> </p><p>                                                                                                                                         \nFollowing breakfast on board, disembark <i>Silver Cloud.\n</i></p><p><i>\n\nExpedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 —</strong><strong> Lisbon, Portugal</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Cloud</em> this afternoon and depart on your exciting 12-day Silversea Expedition — Epicurean Europe. This afternoon you will attend a safety drill before leaving port. Later there will be a Sail Away cocktail and you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and our guest lecturers. Tonight we invite you to the first of many memorable dinners in one of the restaurants, specially prepared by the Culinary Experts and our Executive Chef.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — Leixoes (Oporto), Portugal</strong><br />\n  Oporto is located near the mouth of the Douro River and the second largest city in Portugal. During our visit to the city centre (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) where we will visit the “Bolhao” market, the oldest in town. We will see the impressive 14th century St. Francis Church with its magnificent 18th century gold-encrusted interior. Our day in Oporto would not be complete without a visit to a well-known wine cellar for a taste of some world-famous port wine and to learn how over the years, methods of maturing and blending were refined and continue today. 3 different types of port wine will be offered for tasting. We then proceed to Ribeira, its picturesque riverfront quarter made up of narrow, twisting streets lined with brightly tiled or pastel-painted façades.</p>\n<p>If history is more your field of interest, accompany us to see Guimaraes –a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the cradle of the nation and first capital of Portugal. Our extensive walking tour will take us to the medieval King’s Castle and the 15th century Palace of the Dukes of Bragança. This palace houses a fantastic museum and a beautiful art gallery. On our walking tour we will see the old town with its narrow cobblestone streets and quiet corners. There will be some free time to browse the local shops.</p>\n<p>  Our wine lovers will want to see the Douro Valley (a UNESCO World Heritage Site). This excursion will take you to the village of Peso da Regua and the wine lodge “Quinta da Pacheca”. There we will get acquainted with the different varieties of wine grown and will have a tempting lunch of typical Portuguese specialities using products of the Douro region, accompanied by the best-suited Quinta da Pacheca wines.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 — La Coru</strong><strong>ñ</strong><strong>a, Spain</strong><br />\n  A Coruna (La Coruña) is an important coastal town of Galicia and has the oldest Roman lighthouse still in use (a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Be out on deck early in the morning to see it while <em>Silver Cloud</em> approaches the harbour.</p>\n<p>  Today’s excursion takes you to the city of Santiago de Compostela and its famous Obradoiro Square and the Cathedral. You have two options: you can either walk on one of the most beautiful paths into Santiago – normally made at the end of the “Camino de Santiago”- or you can choose to explore the Plaza Obradoiro in depth. In both cases you will have the opportunity to attend the 12 o’clock mass and see the impressive swing of the incense burner (known as the Botafumeiro). You will have some free time before meeting again at the Square, heading over to the impressive Parador de los Reyes Catolicos for a tapas lunch and wine tasting –and watching the performance of a Galician dance group.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 4 — Ribadessella, Spain</strong><br />\n  Ribadesella serves as the starting point for three very different full day excursions: a drive to Oviedo and Gijon will permit you to visit the culturally and historically important city of Oviedo, the modern capital of Asturias and to enter La Laboral, Spain’s biggest building –holding the “City of Culture” and part of Gijon’s university. A traditional lunch will be served in a local restaurant in Gijon.</p>\n<p>  For nature lovers a visit to the lakes of Covadonga will be of interest. Located within the National Park Los Picos de Europa, beautiful panoramic views of the lakes and surrounding landscape can be enjoyed –as long as fog does not prevent the drive up to the lakes. Covadonga holds a special historical meaning for Spain, as the Reconquista started here in 722 after the first Christian victory over the Moors. Lunch will be served at the Parador de Cangas.</p>\n<p>For those interested in architecture, an excursion to Comillas and Santillana del Mar will let you see “El Capricho”, the modernist palace of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi, and one of the most beautiful and well-preserved towns in Spain. Lunch will be at a Parador in Santillana.&nbsp; <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Bilbao, Spain</strong><br />\n  From <em>Silver Cloud</em> you will be driven along the estuary down to the Gran Via, which reflects Bilbao’s 19th century mining and industrial prosperity, to the heart of the city. On the way you will notice how the city is redefining itself through modern constructions and buildings. Undoubtedly the most emblematic is the Guggenheim Museum of Modern Art -one of Frank Gehry’s masterpieces in flowing titanium and limestone, with sail-like shapes suggesting Bilbao’s maritime heritage. The Museum in itself is a piece of art. Apart from an outside explanation, we will have a 90 minutes specially guided visit. After some free time we will head for a local restaurant for welcome drinks and miniature cuisine known as “pintxos” (the local Basque version of tapas). Reputed to be the best of Spain, the selection will go from grilled wild mushrooms to spicy stuffed peppers.</p>\n<p>  During the afternoon we will cross the Bay of Biscay on our way to France and Bordeaux.<br />\n  Let our food and wine specialists pamper you with more information on delicacies from the Basque region and the Medoc.</p>\n<p><strong>Days 6–7 — Bordeaux, France (Overnight)</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Cloud</em> will get into Bordeaux during the early morning and there will be many choices to spend the two days in and around Bordeaux.</p>\n<p>  After breakfast you might want to get ready for a walking tour of this historic UNESCO World Heritage city. We begin with a look at the 18th century Grand Theatre, one of the most beautiful in Europe. Our walk continues through the old Bordeaux district, taking in the Place du Parlement and Place de la Bourse, the cathedral Saint Andre and the City Hall. Our tour concludes in the luxury boutiques district, called “the triangle” by the locals, and the Quinconces square. During our time ashore we will discover some local traditional specialties, such as chocolate, canelé cake, cheese and of course sample some fine Bordeaux wines.</p>\n<p>  If you think the walking tour will let you gain too many calories, how about jogging through Bordeaux accompanied by an experienced guide –without the tasting of local delicacies?<br />\n  If you like exercise, yet want to taste some wine –select the biking adventure through Saint-Emilion vineyards (with tasting wines at Chateau La Dominique). You will be driven to St-Emilion where your bicycle awaits you. A 90-minute cycling adventure, pedalling along a combination of flat and hilly roads, will let you enjoy the beautiful landscape and famous vineyards you will pass before reaching Chateau La Dominique. Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon are grown on a 30-hectare terroir.</p>\n<p> If you prefer hiking and want to climb Europe’s highest sand dune, then the Pyla sand dune and oyster tasting should be your choice. Driving through the Landes de Gascogne forest, you will be taken to Arcachon Bay and Le Pyla. To climb the 105 metres tall sand dune, wooden steps will make the first part easier. From the top you will have sweeping views of the Landes forest, Arcachon Bay and the sea. Afterwards you will be taken to a local oyster farm, where the owner will share insights into the oyster business before you will get to sample 6 oysters, accompanied with rye bread, butter and dry white wine.</p>\n<p>  For food lovers we have two different choices: to either visit the traditional food market of Creon –some 45 minutes southeast of Bordeaux- tasting bread, ham, cheese, canelé cake (all local produce) during a guided visit; or to delve into Slow Food and visit a conservatory orchard and vegetable garden that specialises in “forgotten” vegetables. In the middle of a landscaped garden you will find more than 600 different species and varieties of edible plants. Most of them have undeservedly disappeared from tables and kitchens and today you will be able to enjoy a commented tasting of those forgotten produces.</p>\n<p><em>Silver Cloud</em> will be docked in Bordeaux overnight, and the evening is yours to spend as you please. Enjoy the comfort of <em>Silver Cloud’s</em> many restaurants, ending the evening with a liqueur in one of the lounges and bars or a cigar in The Connoisseur’s Corner. Or take the opportunity to head out and try one of the many local restaurants for a dinner ashore.<br />\nHaving explored the historical sights of Bordeaux and done some exercise, we then turn to the culinary highlights as well: a French breakfast — how about some fresh local croissants, croque-monsieur, or pain-au-chocolat? — will permit us to be in the best of conditions for a special visit at one of the Bordeaux classified wine estates.</p>\n<p>  Depending on your choice of excursions you will enjoy a special lunch at some of the most acclaimed Michelin star restaurants of the Bordeaux region on one of the two days in Bordeaux. The excursion will visit acclaimed vineyards where you will get to taste different wines before heading to carefully selected restaurants. The beautiful settings of these restaurants will charm you. There you will appreciate the art of careful selection of dishes from a constantly growing repertoire of recipes; the purchase of local products whose flavours go well together; the pairing of food with wine; the setting of a beautiful table; and, obviously, the smelling and tasting of the items at the table. UNESCO has accepted the French gastronomic meal as an intangible cultural world heritage — and Silversea has the pleasure of offering you a memorable meal in a historical setting.</p>\n<p>  During the evening <em>Silver Cloud</em> will leave Bordeaux, cruising down the estuary. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Belle Ile en Mer, France</strong><br />\n  Although one might think that a name like “the beautiful island in the sea” might be a little too poetic, artists and painters have come to love the nature of this largest of the Brittany islands.&nbsp; “Les Aiguilles de Port Coton”, a famous painting by Claude Monet, depicts the wild southern coast and rocks exposed to wind and waves. The island has a ‘soft’ side too. Its northern shore has two ports and long sandy beaches. At the port of Le Palais is one of the historical gems of the island. Mentioned by Alexandre Dumas in his second book about the Three Musketeers, the Citadelle de Belle Ile had great strategic importance as access to the south of Brittany was controlled by Belle Ile and its smaller neighbours Houat and Hoed. The beautifully maintained fort is now a museum. There are other spectacular and unique fortifications along the island’s shore</p>\n<p>  During the afternoon we will go ashore to explore Belle Ile en Mer and its attractions.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Bay of Douarnenez, France </strong><br />\n  Today you have the opportunity to visit Locronan, France’s most picturesque medieval village. Once there, you will have a guided visit and will see the church with its 15th century stained glass depicting the passion of Saint Ronan. At Le Guillou bakery you can taste the traditional Breton butter cake known as “kouign amann” before watching a group of Breton dancers in their traditional costumes, introducing you to Brittany’s rich culture and identity.<br />\n  You can also combine a visit to the medieval town of Quimper with a visit and lunch at a Crêperie in Locronan without the traditional folkloric presentation. In both towns you will have guided walks to see the architectural highlights. </p>\n<p>If you like fresh air and handicraft choose to visit Tronoen, the “Cathedral of the Dunes”. Driving through along the “Pays Bigouden” and picturesque villages you will reach Penmarc’h Cap to walk on the coastguard paths. At Pont L’Abbé you will have a local Breton lunch. In the afternoon you will then be welcomed by the renowned embroiderer Mr. Le Minor, who will talk about the embroidery special to Brittany. As a designer-manufacturer his printed and embroidered fabrics, as well as fashion accessories, decorative tapestries are all steeped in the maritime and cultural identity of Brittany.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Saint-Malo, France </strong><br />\n  Today you have the choice of three different excursions: during the late morning we can visit the legendary Mont Saint Michel (a UNESCO World Heritage Site). After breakfast we will set off for this spectacular granite tidal island, situated on the border between Normandy and Brittany. Upon arrival, we will stroll through the narrow streets of the mediaeval village and up to the Abbey. After descending back down to the village you will free time for shopping or simply enjoying this special place before heading back to Saint-Malo.</p>\n<p>  One other option involves less of a drive: A visit to the Bretagne on a culinary expedition would not be complete without tasting oysters or crêpes. On this excursion you will have a chance to sample both! We will leave Saint-Malo and drive along the coastal road to the picturesque fishing village of Cancale. There, thousands of oysters are farmed in “banc d’huîtres” (oyster beds). We will first taste different varieties of oysters at a local restaurant before heading over to a “Crêperie”. There you will appreciate the flavour of the traditional galette (Crêpe de Sarrasin) served with local farm cider.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in a different culinary aspect of the region, you might want to visit a salt meadow lamb farm near Mont Saint Michel. After learning about the salt meadow lamb –considered a delicacy because of the high salinity and iodine content of the pasture- you will be taken to a nearby restaurant where you will be served a gastronomic menu featuring the delightful salt meadow lamb. </p>\n<p>After these different excursions you should take the opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge about cider and attend a conference and tasting in the Hotel Magon. Built in 1725 for one of the most powerful ship-owners and director of the French East Indies Company, the manor is a Historic Monument. There you will meet a specialist of cider and will get a full explanation of the cider tasting world. After the conference you will taste 4 very different ciders, accompanied by Breton galettes.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Le Havre, France </strong><br />\n  Located at the mouth of the Seine, Le Havre has France’s second most important harbour. Since the town had been heavily bombed during World War II the city centre had to be completely rebuilt. This post-war reconstruction with its systematic use of a modular grid, prefabrication and favouring as material mainly concrete resulted in Le Havre’s central city being declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005 for its outstanding example of urban planning. Le Havre is also considered a green city with Monteon Forest and Rouelles Park located within the Upper Town. The Normandy Bridge, the Seine’s bridge closest to the Channel, was the world’s longest cable-stayed bridge when inaugurated in 1995. This bridge facilitates access to the famous landing beaches of D-Day. </p>\n<p>Today you have to choose between modern history and medieval times: The two excursions to commemorate D-Day differ in one featuring a visit to Arromanches, a visit to the American Cemetery with its 9,386 marble crosses and a drive to Omaha Beach, while the other will start with the American Cemetery and a small ceremony honouring the fallen, proceeding then to Arromanches before returning to Le Havre.</p>\n<p>The “medieval” excursion will head for Rouen and its historical part –the Old Market Place where Joan of Arc was burned in 1431, the modern Joan of Arc Church and the Gothic Cathedral. After having seen the historical highlights, it is time to discover local products visiting a distillery. The Drouin-Coeur de Lion estate is in the heart of the Auge Country. There you will see the process from the apple press to the aging of calvados in oak casks. You will be invited to taste cider, pommeau and calvados, accompanied by three types of delicious Norman cheeses: Camembert, Livarot and Pont L’Eveque.</p>\n<p>Leaving France in the afternoon, <em>Silver Cloud</em> will sail for London.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — London, England </strong><br />\n  Today you have a morning cruise up the very interesting River Thames ahead of you. You will pass the O2 just before crossing the Greenwich Meridian, having a marvellous view of the University of Greenwich, the old Royal Naval College, the National Maritime Museum and Greenwich Park. We will go past the splendidly renovated Cutty Sark and Canary Wharf. As a further highlight <em>Silver Cloud</em> will pass the Tower Bridge and the impressive Tower of London.</p>\n<p>During the day you can embark on a panoramic tour showing you the essential highlights London has to offer. The tour will pass St. Paul’s Cathedral, Trafalgar Square with Nelson’s Column, and the National Gallery, continuing on towards Buckingham Palace, St. James’s Park and The Mall. From London’s main ceremonial avenue we travel down to Whitehall and Downing Street before entering Parliament Square. You will see the historic Houses of Parliament, Big Ben and the immense structure of the magnificent Westminster Abbey. The tour then heads back down the Embankment towards <em>Silver Cloud</em>. </p>\n<p>In the evening Silversea and the Royal Geographical Society have arranged for a very special reception at the Royal Geographical Society’s headquarter. You will enjoy a reception across the ground floor of the Society, soaking up the atmosphere of the Map Room and Hall. You will then be escorted into the Ondaatje Theatre for a welcome by the Silversea’s representatives, Alasdair MacLeod, Head of Collection &amp; Resources, RSG-IGB, and a guest speaker.<br />\n  &nbsp;<br />\n  Following the welcome there will be an “Open House” style evening – guests can enjoy private views of the Society’s Collections in the Foyle Reading Room while refreshments will be served in the Fine Rooms of the Society’s historic home.&nbsp; From over two million items in its Collections, the specially curated exhibit will include artefacts, maps, photographs, archival and personal items used by famous Antarctic and Arctic explorers (including Scott, Shackleton, Mawson, Amundsen, Nansen and Peary), plus a selection of iconic pieces from the Society’s wider holdings which document world exploration over 500 years. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 – London, England </strong><br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Cloud</em><em>.</em><br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — London, England<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Cloud</em> this afternoon for your exciting Silversea Expedition — “Celtic Spring”. A mandatory safety drill will be followed by an introduction to your Expedition Team. Tonight we invite you to attend the first of many memorable meals in one of the restaurants.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 — London, England<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  The morning is spent travelling down the River Thames, starting with the special highlight of <em>Silver Cloud</em> passing the impressive Tower of London and the Tower Bridge. Heading downriver we will be passing Canary Wharf, the superbly restored Cutty Sark, and Greenwich with its National Maritime Museum. <em>Silver Cloud</em> will be crossing the Greenwich Meridian, having a marvellous view of the University of Greenwich, the old Royal Naval College, the National Maritime Museum and Greenwich Park just before the O2 will be rounded.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon <em>Silver Cloud</em> will enter the North Sea, heading for the English Channel. Attend one of the lectures preparing you for the different natural and human highlights awaiting you on this voyage.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 — St Peter Port, Guernsey<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong></p><p>\n  Guernsey is only 25 square miles, but presents a surprising variety of beautiful and historic attractions. <br />\n  For fit walkers a cliff walk will be offered. A long gradual climb of approximately 2 hours will lead to cliff tops affording great views overlooking the south coast cliffs. This walk will meander past an abundance of wildflowers along the pretty Petit Port Bay, arriving at the Jerbourg Hotel from where you will be driven to Les Cotils for a delicious Guernsey cream tea.</p>\n<p>Our second tour will depart the St Peter Port pier for a scenic drive to a silver and goldsmith’s workshop to see the craftsmen at work. The workshop and showroom are set in 8 acres of award-winning grounds. After browsing at leisure you will embark on a guided nature walk to truly appreciate the stunning grounds before enjoying a local refreshment called the Guernsey Gâche (a sultana fruit loaf served with Guernsey butter and tea or coffee).</p>\n<p>The third excursion will take us back in time to see how life on Guernsey was during World War II. The Channel Islands were the only part of England to be occupied by the German forces and we will visit the La Valette Underground Museum which houses a mass of WW II memorabilia. Departing the museum the tour will continue along the beautiful West coast of Guernsey. On the return the charming “Little Chapel” will be briefly visited.&nbsp; </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — St Mary’s and Tresco, Isles of Scilly </strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Cloud</em> will anchor between St. Mary’s and Tresco and during the morning local boats will take you ashore to explore the lovely St. Mary’s on your own. You might want to go birding or take a look at Star Castle, the Garrison Walls and the surrounding landscape.</p>\n<p>To many, Tresco is the most attractive of the Isles of Scilly, especially with its Abbey Gardens. This afternoon we will go ashore by Zodiac for a guided tour of this world-renowned attraction which is home to thousands of exotic plant species from 80 countries (ranging from Brazil to New Zealand and Myanmar to South Africa). Botanist and plant collector Augustus Smith began the gardens in the 1830s on the site of an old Benedictine Abbey by channelling the weather up and over a network of walled enclosures built around the Priory ruins. He had three terraces carved from the rocky south slope and, in this way, maximised Tresco’s mild Gulf Stream climate. Here, there are generally more hours of sunshine and less rainfall than the UK average, and many of these plants would stand no chance on the Cornish mainland, less than 30 miles away. Quite interesting is the collection of Galleon figureheads the garden has on exhibit. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Pembroke, St. Davids, and Skomer Island, Wales</strong><br />\n  If you like to walk, your day begins with a drive to Kete where you will begin a walk towards St Ann’s Head and then along the Coastal Path. On the walk you will see old and new lighthouses, coastguard cottages and Mill Bay, where Henry Tudor landed in 1485. This 7 km walking tour takes about 2 hours –the surfaces of the path can vary considerably with the weather.</p>\n<p>  If you prefer history, then join us on an excursion to either Picton Castle or Pembroke Castle. Picton Castle is probably Britain’s most unusual ancient building, as it was designed as part fortified manor house and part medieval castle. You will be treated to an exclusive visit with stewards in each room ready to answer any questions. Leaving the castle enjoy a glass of sparkling wine before visiting one of the most beautiful woodland gardens in West Wales. Discover the woodland walks, ferns and the abundant wildflowers that blend with unusual woodland shrubs. You can also visit the Walled Garden.</p>\n<p>  Pembroke Castle in turn is the second largest castle in Wales. Built in the 12th century it was the birthplace of Henry VII. The massive walls with five projecting towers and a great keep (21 metres high and 6 metres thick at the base) guarded the strategically important town of Pembroke. Enjoy a guided tour of this impressive castle. </p>\n<p>  During the afternoon we have planned a Zodiac cruise to explore the cliffs of small Skomer Island off the southwest coast of Wales. Accessible only by boat, Skomer has a large population of breeding seabirds that include Manx Shearwaters, guillemots, Razorbills, Great Cormorants, Black-legged Kittiwakes, Atlantic Puffins, European Storm Petrels, Common Shags, Eurasian Oystercatchers and gulls, as well as birds of prey including Short-eared Owls, Common Kestrels and Peregrine Falcons. The island is also home to a variety of wildflowers. Harbour porpoises and grey seals can usually be seen in the surrounding waters.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Skellig Islands and Knightstown, Valentia Island </strong><br />\n  Our day begins a visit to the magnificent Skellig Islands that lie 8 miles off the coast of Portmagee in South West Kerry. Rising majestically from the sea, Skellig Michael towers 714ft. above sea level. On the summit of this awe-inspiring rock you will find a remarkably well preserved sixth century monastic settlement now designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Small Skellig is equally renowned in matters of ornithology as the home of some 27,000 pairs of gannets – one of the largest colonies in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; The final scene of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” was shot on Skellig. The remains of the Skellig Michael monastery appear in the film, representing an ancient Jedi temple. </p>\n<p>  With a population of 156 inhabitants, Knightstown is the largest settlement on Valentia Island. From the port we will travel east to two different estates and gardens:<br />\n  One excursion will visit Derrynane House. Today some 120 hectares of the lands of Derrynane, together with the Derrynane House, make up the Derrynane National Historic Park. After visiting the house you will have free time to explore the estate and garden.</p><p>The second excursion we will go to Kells Gardens, one of Ireland’s foremost Victorian Gardens. The garden contains a large collection of plants from the Southern Hemisphere and the spectacular topography and the almost subtropical climate are favourable to the growth of ornamental plants from many parts of the world. You will enjoy a guided walk and have time to explore on your own. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 — Cliffs of Moher and Galway, Ireland </strong><br />\n  Our day begins with a very early visit to the Burren and Cliffs of Moher UNESCO Global Geopark. The cliffs are made up of various types of perpendicular or overhanging rocks and have been broken into the most fantastic forms, eroding into hundreds of caves by the Atlantic waves. The views from <em>Silver Cloud</em> will show the extensive area of nature’s impact on geology.</p>\n<p>  The area can later be explored on land visiting Aillwee Cave, Ireland’s most impressive cave in the heart of the Burren –from the Gaelic word Boireann. This area of limestone rocks, majestic mountains and tranquil valleys houses over 2700 archaeological monuments and has Arctic, Alpine and Mediterranean flowers. </p>\n<p>Galway is the capital of the West of Ireland, but if you want to know about farming in Ireland, join an excursion to Rathbaum Farm, where the owners will offer morning tea, coffee and scones and be at hand to explain about life outside the cities and towns. They will also show how sheep are manoeuvred with the help of a dog. Photographic stops will be made on the way at Dunguaire Castle and Galway Cathedral.</p>\n<p>Your full day excursion into the Connemara country will lead to Kylemore Abbey and the Victorian Walled Garden. Home to the Irish Benedictine Nuns, Kylemore Abbey is regarded as one of Ireland’s most romantic buildings. The flower garden is a delight, with two glasshouses and a kitchen garden also quite productive. At Clifden, known as the “Capital of Connemara”, you will have lunch and time for some independent exploration. On the return you will drive through Recess, Derryneen and Maam Cross and will understand why Connemara is regarded as the “Emerald of Ireland”.<br />\n  &nbsp;<br />\n  In the evening, Galway, Ireland’s fourth most populous urban area, offers either local life in a pub with live traditional music, local pub food and drinks –or you can stay onboard and listen to a local band coming to play aboard <em>Silver Cloud</em>. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 — Kilronan, Aran Islands, and Clare Island, Ireland </strong><br />\n  The Aran Islands are rich in language, culture and heritage of Ireland. Inis Mor has about 900 inhabitants and the main village on the island is Kilronan. The Aran Islands are a great place for peace and tranquillity with weathered monuments, labyrinths of limestone and a patchwork of fields. The most spectacular national monument on the islands is Dun Aonghus (The Fort of Aonghus) with its semi-circular shape at the edge of a cliff. It is one of Europe’s finest prehistoric fortresses.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon we will visit Clare Island, the largest of the 100 islands in Clew Bay. Five miles long by 3 miles wide, the island has 160 inhabitants dedicated mainly to farming, fishing and tourism. We will offer two different hikes to see the cliffs and lighthouses, as well as the island’s flora and fauna and to see the archaeological sites from Bronze Age to modern times –including Granuaile’s Castle. Clare Island was home of the infamous Pirate Queen Grace O Malley. The spectacular cliffs to the north are home to large numbers of seabirds.</p>\n<p>In the evening you will see how Clare Island comes to life as some of the best shanos singers will present themselves at Sailors Bar. There you will enjoy a cultural experience combining traditional Irish music, story-telling and delicious seafood and local delicacies. The Sailors Bar Restaurant’s specialty is smoked mackerel, crab claws and smoked salmon. Farmed here and smoked on neighbouring Achill Island, Clare Island Smoked Salmon –the world’s most premium farmed salmon- will be accompanied by home-baked tasty brown bread. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — Killibegs </strong><br />\n  From the fishing village of Killibeg you will either be driven to The Bluestack Mountain Range of Southwest Donegal for a walk to the ancient Disert Graveyard and a Holy Well dating to the times of St Colmcille (mid-6th century) or to drive to Glencomcille Folk Village.</p>\n<p>  At the foothills of the Bluestacks the circular walk (with a length of 3.5 kilometres) circles the National Monument on existing roads and tracks and offers many vantage points for magnificent views of the surrounding Bluestack Mountains and Donegal Bay.</p>\n<p>At the Glencolmcille Folk Village you will be able to experience what Ireland’s past of poverty and hardship meant. The Glencolmcille Museum will show the bygone lifestyle through craft shops, a tea house, a school house (where you can get a tuition in Irish language), as well as replica cottages from the 18th to the 20th century. As Donegal is renowned for its tweed, a demonstration of spinning and weaving is also available. While tea and scones are served, local musicians will treat you to some traditional Irish music.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Portrush, Northern Ireland </strong><br />\n  During our visit we will drive along the spectacular and unspoilt Antrim Coast of Northern Ireland to reach Dunluce Castle. Epic struggles between warring Gaelic families caused many castles to be built in defensive positions along the North Antrim coast. The rambling ruins of the 17th-century castle with its towers and gables cling precariously to a black basalt crag, and are dramatically surrounded by terrifyingly steep drops. The castle will be quite familiar to some, as it has prominently featured in “Game of Thrones”. Enjoy a guided tour of the castle.</p>\n<p>  Next we experience the Giant’s Causeway — one of Northern Ireland’s most famous landmarks. Legend has it that the Irish giant, Finn McCool, constructed the causeway so he could cross the sea to Scotland and thus be with his lady love. In reality, the Causeway’s 40,000 stone columns, mostly hexagonal, formed millions of years ago with the cooling of molten lava. For centuries, visitors have marvelled at the rugged symmetry of the columns and their ability to withstand the unbridled ferocity of Atlantic storms. UNESCO has recognised this unique site with World Heritage status.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 — Dublin, Ireland </strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Cloud</em>.</p>\n<p><br />\n  <em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 —</strong><strong> Dublin, Ireland</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Cloud</em> this afternoon for your exciting Silversea Expedition — “Exploring the British Isles”. A mandatory safety drill will be followed by an introduction to your Expedition Team. Tonight we invite you to attend the first of many memorable meals in one of the restaurants.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 —</strong><strong> Douglas, Isle of Man</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  Apart from an independent visit to the Manx Museum in Douglas, the Isle of Man has two quite distinct options for you: you can either walk along part on the coastline on one of the island’s most beautiful walks, or you can choose to take a vintage steam train towards the former capital of Castletown.</p>\n<p>  For the “Southern Cliffs” walking tour you will be driven to the Folk Village of Cregneash, from where you stroll through farmland to The Chasm, a local landmark.&nbsp; There you can have excellent views of the nesting seabirds, continuing on an easy coastal path to The Sound. A renowned bird sanctuary is located just across this body of water and grey seals frequent the area. At The Sound you will board your bus to return to the pier.</p>\n<p>  If you are a train buff, then you should either take the excursion by train from Douglas to Castletown to see the magnificent Castle Rushden, one of the best examples of a medieval castle in Europe dating back to the year 1200, or combine the train ride with a special culinary touch: travelling in lovingly restored dining cars through the Manx landscape with breathtaking scenery and coastal views, you will enjoy a tasting menu of the freshest seasonal Manx produce and Manx craft ales. </p>\n<p>  Whichever you choose, you are sure to enjoy the magnificent views either walking or riding the train.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 —</strong><strong> Iona and Lunga, Scotland&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  This morning we arrive at Iona Island.&nbsp; St Columba came here from Ireland in 563 AD and early Christianity spread through northern Britain from this remote island community. Forty-eight Kings of Scotland are buried here, including Duncan, Macbeth’s victim. Once ashore we will visit Iona Abbey, one of Scotland’s most sacred and historical sites. The abbey was restored during the early 20th century, and today the Iona Community continues the tradition of worship first established by St Columba.</p>\n<p> The Tresnish Isles, protecting the western approaches to Mull, will be <em>Silver Cloud’s</em> afternoon’s destination. Lunga, the largest of them, has 2000-plus pairs of Atlantic Puffins that breed on the island’s plateau of short turf. Other birds include storm petrels, Manx Shearwaters and Black-legged Kittiwakes. Guillemots, puffins, Corncrakes and Razorbills breed on Lunga and nearby Harp Rock, but the island is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of its abundant plant life! Many rare and endangered plants are native to Lunga. These include Primroses, Birdsfoot Trefoil, and orchids, Sea Campion, Thrift and Tormentil.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 —</strong><strong> Oban and Mallaig, Scotland</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  Today we will combine a visit to the Scottish Highlands with one of the “Great railway journeys of the world”. &nbsp;Departing Oban we will head east by coach going through the Pass of Brander, past Loch Awe -stopping for views of Kilchurn Castle- towards Rannoch Moor, one of the last remaining wildernesses in Europe. Through Glencoe we will again go along the shores of Lock Linnhe until we reach Fort William, the largest town in the West Highlands. After lunch at a local hotel, we will board the Jacobite train for an 84-mile route that covers some of Scotland’s “most/best” list: we start near Ben Nevis, Britain’s highest mountain, and will pass close by of Loch Morar, Britain’s deepest freshwater loch, to end the journey next to the deepest seawater loch having crossed Britain’s shortest river. The train uses locomotives dating back to the 1930s and 1940s, while the coaches are 1960s ex-British Railways Mark 1s. Truly one of the great railway journeys of the world.</p>\n<p>  In Mallaig we will again board <em>Silver Cloud.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 —</strong><strong> Portree, Isle of Skye, Scotland</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  To give you time to explore the charming port of Portree on your own in the afternoon you will have three morning choices for excursions in the morning.</p>\n<p>  You can head to Waternish Peninsula to the village of Stein and the Skyeskyns tannery to learn about traditional leather making. Enjoy a guided tour of the workshop, seeing the traditional implements and understanding the lengthy hand finishing processes to create the world famous Highland hand-combed fleece exclusive to Skyeskyns. </p>\n<p>  Or visit one of the most renowned castles Hebridean/Scottish castles. You can either visit Eilean Castle, arguably one of the most recognisable castles in the world. Restored in the 1930s, three floors can be visited to understand the rich history of the castle and its clansmen. On this excursion some of the best Highlands home-baking will be offered at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge. If you choose Dunvegan Castle, you will drive across the lovely Isle of Skye to its west coast. Dunvegan Castle has been continuously owned and used by the same family for over 800 years. The castle has been the seat of the Clan MacLeod chiefs since the 13th century. Explore the castle and the lovely gardens that surround the waterfall known as Rory Mor’s cascade. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 —</strong><strong> St. Kilda, Scotland</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  We approach St. Kilda in the early morning. This remarkable and uninhabited archipelago some 50 miles beyond the Outer Hebrides is very rarely visited. </p>\n<p>  St. Kilda is one of the few places in the world to have received dual World Heritage status from UNESCO in recognition of its Natural Heritage and cultural significance. <em>Silver Cloud</em> will drop anchor off Village Bay on the island of Hirta. Weather conditions permitting, we will go ashore using our Zodiacs to visit the westernmost landmass in the United Kingdom. St. Kilda once supported a population of over 200, but the last islanders left in the 1930s. Recent restoration work on the village by the National Trust for Scotland offers a marvellous link with the past. </p>\n<p>  The stunning cliffs and sea stacks are home to the most important seabird breeding colony in north-west Europe and during the late afternoon <em>Silver Cloud</em> will sail past two of the largest gannetries in the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 —</strong><strong> Kirkwall, Orkney Islands, Scotland</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  Kirkwall and the Orkney Islands can offer some very different aspects of human history and use of the islands: you can choose to see the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Neolithic Heartland of Orkney, visiting the Ring of Brodgar, a huge ceremonial circle of stones dating back some 5,000 years, and the 5,000-year-old village of Skara Brae before returning to Kirkwall and the St Magnus Cathedral, built during the Viking reign of the islands.</p>\n<p>  You could also choose to head for the smaller South Isles, passing Scapa Flow, driving over the Churchill Barriers, built during World War II to protect Scapa Flow, to reach the island of Burray and stopping at Burray Village for delicious refreshments consisting of local produce including Bere Bannock (local bread) and local farmhouse cheese, Orkney Fudge and Orkney ice cream with a glass of wine or beer.</p>\n<p>  If you would like to taste something “more’ typical of Scotland and the Orkneys, then you might want to consider a visit to the Highland Park distillery, one of the world’s most northerly whisky distilleries.&nbsp; You will drive to the South Isles and will have an in-depth tour of the distillery and will get to taste whisky of 12, 15, 18 and 25 years of age. On the return you will have time to visit St Magnus Cathedral.</p>\n<p>  In the evening head out to a dinner and party in true Orcadian style. You will head out to West Mainland and will spend the evening at one of the country community halls. Seated at communal tables a buffet style supper will be served with local shellfish and Orkney beef. Local story-tellers will entertain with traditional tales of Orkney folklore. After dessert the area will be cleared for a mini-ceilidh. With the help of a traditional dance caller and a local band guests will learn traditional Orkney dances and get a chance to practice their new dance skills. If you need some inspiration (or courage) try the traditional Orkney Cog –a unique wooden drinking vessel filled with a warm spiced brew mix. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 —</strong><strong> Lerwick and Isle of Noss, Shetland Islands, Scotland</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  Explore the historical part of Lerwick during a walking tour. Starting from Victoria Pier, the heart of the Old Town, you will be seeing houses, warehouses, slipways and fish-drying sheds dating back to the 18th century, when Lerwick was the premier herring town in Northern Europe. You will also see the Up Helly Aa Exhibition with its replica Viking boat and colourful exhibitions, before seeing the fascinating Shetland Museum with its more than 3,000 artefacts. Enjoy refreshments and scones at the museum’s café.</p>\n<p>  If you are interested in Neolithic history, join the excursion to see the remarkable archaeological site of Jarlshof. The site contains a sequence of late Neolithic houses, a Bronze-Age village, an Iron-Age broch and wheelhouse, several Norse longhouses, a medieval farmstead and a 16th century house.&nbsp; Later see Shetland’s oldest lighthouse at Sumburgh Head, and look for the thousands of seabirds attracted by the cliffs. Puffins, fulmars, gannets, shags and guillemots can be seen during this time of the year.<br />\n  You could also just head to Sumburgh Head, to spend more time looking for the birds and marine mammals that frequent this area.</p>\n<p>  If you want hiking, birding and history combined, join us for visit to the uninhabited island of Mousa. There you will be doing a circular walk on the 1.5 square mile island to spot different birds and common and grey seals, and climb the Mousa Broch, an impressive Iron-Age fortress tower which stands 13 metres in height and is the best preserved of its type.<br />\n  In the afternoon, <em>Silver Cloud</em> repositions to the Isle of Noss for Zodiac cruises along the spectacular cliffs and their bird colonies.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 —</strong><strong> Fair Isle, Scotland</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  Geographically divided into two distinct areas, the miniscule 3.5 by 1.5-mile Fair Isle features high moorland areas and cliffs in the north and flatter, fertile lands in the south. Eighteen crofts ranging in size from 3-20 hectares are pretty much the mainstay of the 70 residents. Due to the island’s phenomenal seabird collection, Britain’s most isolated inhabited island is protected by the Fair Isle Marine Environment &amp; Tourism Initiative. Here we find a population density and diversity of seabird species that may well be unequalled in all of Europe. We will take our Zodiacs ashore to look for thousands of Atlantic Puffins, Northern Fulmars, Black-legged Kittiwakes, Razorbills, and Black Guillemots, with skuas and terns on the moorland. There's also a small colony of Northern Gannets. With any luck, we might catch a glimpse of the endemic Fair Isle Wren. Islanders will accompany us on the walk to the newly refurbished bird observatory. You can visit the museum and while you have tea and home-baking with the islanders in their community hall, have a look at the knitwear produced on the island –crafts will be on sale. Nature lovers will also note the more than 250 plant species found on this small island. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 —</strong><strong> Aberdeen, Scotland</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  Aberdeen brands itself as the “Energy capital of Europe”, but is mainly known as the “granite City”, based on the many buildings made out of locally quarried granite.</p>\n<p>  You can see a number of these impressive buildings during a panoramic drive to visit one of the largest indoor gardens in Europe, the David Welch Winter Gardens at Duthie Park. The gardens are home to a large collection of plants from around the world and include the Tropical House, Japanese Garden, Corridor of Perfumes, the Fern House, the Temperate House, and the Victorian Corridor. Choose the areas of interest to explore independently.</p><p>If you would like to visit a countryside garden and a castle, join the half day tour to visit the stunning Crathes Castle and its gardens. You will drive through Royal Deeside to see one of the most beautiful and well-preserved castles in Scotland and the walled garden which is home to beautiful borders, ancient yew hedges, a rose garden, a fountain and a glass house.</p><p>On a full day tour you can visit two of the finest castles of Royal Deeside: apart from Crathes Castle you will also get to visit Balmoral, a favourite Royal retreat and the Scottish home of the Royal family. &nbsp;As it is still used by the Royal family, Balmoral is only open for a short time each summer. You will see the gardens, exhibitions about the estate, its wildlife and Royal life; and you will also be able to visit the Ballroom, the castle’s largest room. Lunch will be had at a hotel near Balmoral.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 —</strong><strong> Eyemouth, Scotland</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  From Eyemouth you can go south into England on a full day tour to see Lindisfarne and Alnwick Castle. The island of Lindisfarne can only be reached at low tide via a causeway and this will influence our timings today. Upon arrival on Holy Island –as Lindisfarne is also known- we will enjoy some free time to explore the village and Priory ruins before visiting Lindisfarne Castle. The iconic Alnwick Castle, the second-largest inhabited castle in England, has featured in many films and television –most recently in Downton Abbey- and houses an enviable collection of fine art. The Castle Gardens are home to one of the country’s largest collections of European plants in striking geometric beds, themed gardens and a fabulous garden design. Lunch will be “Fish and Chips” at the Castle Friary.</p>\n<p>  Nature lovers will want to head out to St Abb’s Head on the Berwickshire coast. This National Nature Reserve offers extensive nature walks through rich grasslands along the rugged coastline. The dramatic cliffs provide spectacular vantage points to watch thousands of nesting guillemots, kittiwakes and Razorbills. </p>\n<p>  Art lovers will want to choose a visit to Floors Castle. Not only is it the largest inhabited house in Scotland, home to the Duke and Duchess of Roxburghe, it also houses an outstanding collection of fine art, 17th century French furniture, rare tapestries and porcelain. You can explore the grounds and beautiful gardens originating from a formal design laid out in the first half of the 18th century.</p>\n<p>  If you like literature you might decide to see Sir Walter Scott’s home, Abbotsford House. One of Scotland’s most fascinating places, you can explore the historic house and discover a treasure trove of intriguing objects and unusual artefacts which inspired Scott’s greatest novels and poems. Take time to wander through the beautiful formal gardens and tranquil woodlands before returning to Eyemouth.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 —</strong><strong> Kingston upon Hull, England</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  Kingston upon Hull is the perfect starting point for an excursion to see York and York Minster. York was an important Roman city and part of the original city walls remain. After a short panoramic tour of York you will continue on to the celebrated York Minster, Northern Europe’s largest Cathedral. A guided tour will feature the highlights of the cathedral, including the famous 14th century stained glass.</p>\n<p>  Architecture and history lovers will have to choose if they want to see Castle Howard, one of Britain’s most impressive examples of British Baroque architecture and one of the highlights of British Gardens during a full day tour or the Burton Agnes Hall and Gardens on a half day tour. Castle Howard has annual displays of daffodils, rhododendrons, delphiniums and roses, while the delightful gardens of Burton Agnes Hall contain over 4,000 different plant species, including a jungle garden and a national collection of campanulas.</p>\n<p>  Art and plant lovers might prefer the National Collection of Hardy Water Lilies at Stewart’s Burnby Hall Gardens.&nbsp; This is the perfect time of the year to visit the 9 acres of beautifully laid out gardens and lakes. There are more than 80 varieties of water lilies and the setting is the biggest collection of hardy water lilies found in a natural setting anywhere in Europe.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13 —</strong><strong> Ramsgate, England</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  At Ramsgate you will either embark on an excursion to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Canterbury Cathedral or head for the medieval town of Sandwich and Dover Castle.<br />\n  Apart from driving through the heartland of the county of Kent –known as the “Garden of England”- you will be visiting the historic and picturesque city of Canterbury with its labyrinth of medieval streets and quaint shops and the magnificent Norman cathedral that still dominates the city’s skyline.</p>\n<p>  If you choose Dover Castle, you will be first taken through the maze of ancient streets, gateways, churches and timber-framed houses of Sandwich’s Old Town. Dover Castle’s strategic location was already used in the Iron Age, and today you can enjoy exhibitions taking you back in time, to see the medieval tunnels, visit the ‘secret’ World War II tunnels, walk the Battlements and take in the fabulous views from the magnificent cliff top location.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14 —</strong><strong> London, England</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Cloud</em> will pass the Tower Bridge and will be across from the impressive Tower of London in the very early hours of the morning.</p>\n<p>  During the day you can embark on a panoramic tour showing you the essential highlights London has to offer. The tour will pass St. Paul’s Cathedral, Trafalgar Square with Nelson’s Column, and the National Gallery, continuing on towards Buckingham Palace, St. James’s Park and The Mall. From London’s main ceremonial avenue we travel down to Whitehall and Downing Street before entering Parliament Square. You will see the historic Houses of Parliament, Big Ben and the immense structure of the magnificent Westminster Abbey. The tour then heads back down the Embankment towards <em>Silver Cloud</em>. </p>\n<p>  In the evening Silversea and the Royal Geographical Society have arranged for a very special reception at the Royal Geographical Society’s headquarter.</p>\n<p>  You will enjoy a reception across the ground floor of the Society, soaking up the atmosphere of the Map Room and Hall. You will then be escorted into the Ondaatje Theatre for a welcome by the Silversea’s representatives, Alasdair MacLeod, Head of Collection &amp; Resources, RSG-IGB, and a guest speaker. </p>\n<p>  Following the welcome there will be an “Open House” style evening – guests can enjoy private views of the Society’s Collections in the Foyle Reading Room while refreshments will be served in the Fine Rooms of the Society’s historic home.&nbsp; From over two million items in its Collections, the specially curated exhibit will include artefacts, maps, photographs, archival and personal items used by famous Antarctic and Arctic explorers (including Scott, Shackleton, Mawson, Amundsen, Nansen and Peary), plus a selection of iconic pieces from the Society’s wider holdings which document world exploration over 500 years. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 15 —</strong><strong> London, England</strong><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Cloud.</em> </p>\n<p><br />\n  <em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Leith Edinburgh), Scotland</b>\n</p><p>Embark the <i>Silver Cloud</i> and depart on your exciting 12-day Silversea Expedition – “To the&nbsp;Land of the Midnight Sun”. After settling into your suite and attending a safety drill we will be setting sail. Meet the members of your Expedition Team in the Lecture Theatre and attend the first of many memorable dinners in one of the restaurants.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 2 — John O’Groats, Scotland</b>\t</p><p>\nJohn O’Groats, often called “the end of the road”, is a fantastic, unspoilt location. The most northerly point in mainland Britain, the RSPB’s reserve of Dunnet Head has stunning sea cliffs, with some very diverse coastal heathland and grassland habitats. Special plants such as spring squill, thrift and roseroot thrive there. </p><p>\n\nThe area around John O’Groats is recognised as one of the best places in the UK to see Atlantic Puffins during their breeding season. Other seabirds include guillemots, Northern Fulmars, oystercatchers, shags, Black-legged Kittiwakes and a variety of gulls. \nDuring our Zodiac cruises we will view the nesting seabirds in the inlets, ledges and on the stacks.\n</p><p>\nGrey and common seals, dolphins and orcas (killer whales) can also be seen along the Caithness coast. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 3 — Lerwick, Shetland, Scotland</b>\n</p><p>Charming sandstone buildings line the waterfront of this historic seaport. Lerwick is the northernmost town in Scotland and the capital of Shetland.\n</p><p>Our morning excursion travels south, admiring the view of the magnificent Mousa Broch, the tallest and best preserved of all brochs in the world.  You will continue down the west coast passing St Ninian’s Isle where the famous Pictish horde of silver dating from the 9th Century was found in 1958.\n\n</p><p>Continue south to visit the remarkable archaeological site of Jarlshof.  The site was uncovered by a violent storm in the winter of 1896/7, revealing an extraordinary settlement site embracing at least 5,000 years of human history.  The site contains a remarkable sequence of stone structures – late Neolithic houses, a Bronze-Age village, an Iron-Age broch and wheelhouses, several Norse longhouses, a medieval farmstead, and the 16th-century laird’s house.   Visit the remains of these village settlements with your guide.\n</p><p>\nYou will then depart for the RSPB Reserve at Sumburgh Head where you will see Shetland’s first lighthouse, built in 1821 by Robert Stevenson. The cliffs around Sumburgh Head are on the southernmost tip of Mainland Shetland and attract thousands of seabirds, including puffins, guillemots, shags and fulmars. Gannets are regularly seen off shore too. The seas here are home to various animals and you may be lucky enough to see harbour porpoises (neesicks), white-beaked dolphins and whales – killer, minke and even humpback whales are sometimes seen. Common seals often haul themselves out onto the rocks. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 4 — Geiranger, Norway</b>\t</p><p>\nOf Norway’s many fjords, Geirangerfjord is doubtless the most beautiful. Impressive mountains, numerous waterfalls as well as farms clinging to the steep hillsides give the fjord its unique character. Our excursion takes us uphill past the wooden, octagonal Geiranger Church, through the wild Flydal valley where a scenic overview stop is made, and continues around hairpin bends to Lake Djupvatn, and the summit of Mount Dalsnibba (1,500 metres.) From here, there is an amazing panorama of mountains, waterfalls and lakes.\n</p><p>\nAlternatively (and weather permitting) the more energetic can spend a few hours kayaking the quiet and spectacular Geirangerfjord with two-person kayaks. Geirangerfjord is one of nature’s masterpieces and on UNESCO’s World Heritage List. Its description as “the world’s most beautiful fjord” is no exaggeration and it is amidst this dramatic mountain setting that we can experience some spectacular sea kayaking. Our kayaks provide an amazing perspective from which to view the cascading waterfalls and steep mountain walls that rise as high as 1500m\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 5 — Cruise the Norwegian Fjords, Norway</b>\t</p><p>\nAs we head north along Norway’s magnificent shore, <i>Silver Cloud</i> will cruise along mountainous islands, through steep-walled fjords and narrow channels. Be out on deck to discover these special places.\n</p><p>\nOur lecturers will present interesting talks and seminars, but you can also relax at the pool and let the impressive landscape go past while enjoying a drink.\n</p><p>\nHave lunch al fresco and sample some of the exquisite cuisine prepared by our team of international chefs.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 6 — Leknes, Norway</b>\t</p><p>\nAlthough Leknes is a town on Vestvågøy in the Lofoten Islands, it is connected by bridges and tunnels to the mainland. Once we are ashore we will offer excursions for birders and those interested in the human history of the islands.\n</p><p>\nVarious seabirds have found their home in Eggum, located on the western side of Vestvågøy Island. On our birding excursion we will see (if we are lucky) gannets, cormorants, Eider Ducks, shags, Great Skuas and Arctic Skuas, Black Guillemots, kittiwakes and Arctic Terns. En route, we pass the Borgpollen Bay where we may observe Black-throated Divers, Red-throated Divers, Tufted Ducks and scaups. Further on, during a stop by Lake Storied we have the possibility to see Black-tailed Godwits, Bluethroats, Slavonian Grebes and a variety of ducks.\nAlternatively, choose to visit the remarkably well-preserved Nusfjord Fishing Village. The building complex with the wharf and 52 structures — including 34 rorbu (fishermen dwellings) — dates mostly from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We will also visit the Lofotr Viking Museum. Discovered in the 1980s when a farmer was ploughing his land, excavations revealed the remains of the largest building ever (83 metres long) to be found from the Viking realm. We will tour the reconstructed long house and gain insight into the life of a Viking chieftain.\n</p><p>\n\n<b>Day 7 — Tromsø, Norway</b>\t</p><p>\nBecause of many arctic expeditions having started in Tromsø the town is known as the “Gateway to the Arctic”. To see the different aspects of these expeditions and the town’s involvement in hunting, trapping, sealing, and whaling, visit the two museums dedicated to the Arctic: the Polar Museum and Polaria. You can also see the northernmost botanical garden with its surprising variety of plants growing this far north. Tromsø’s churches are quite interesting –the wooden Lutheran church in town or the “Ice Cathedral” on the mainland can easily be reached. A spectacular view of the town and the surrounding area can be had taking the cable car to the top of Storsteinen, 421 metres above sea level. You could also visit Norway’s northernmost brewery and taste its beer. There are many ways to keep you busy this morning.\n</p><p>\nDuring the afternoon <i>Silver Cloud</i> will head out to sea and our lecturers will take the opportunity to prepare you for our stay in Svalbard.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 8 — Bear Island (Bjørnøya), Norway</b>\t</p><p>\nAs we near the southern tip of this arctic island, now a nature reserve, we will see thousands of seabirds diving into and out of the island’s steep cliffs.\n\t\nWith our Zodiacs and favourable weather conditions, we will explore the rugged coastline. Close to 9 kilometres of cliffs are home to some of the largest bird colonies of the Northern Hemisphere. Common Guillemots, Brünnich’s Guillemots, Black-legged Kittiwakes, Northern Fulmars, and Glaucous Gulls are all found along the cliff. Other species have been observed, including puffins and even gannets. Of the more than 120 species registered, slightly more than 30 actually breed on the island. The Expedition Team will provide insights into the environment, the terrain, and the wildlife that exist in these extreme conditions. </p><p>\n\nLeaving Bear Island head out on deck to watch for whales -white-beaked dolphins and minke whales are known to frequent the area.\n</p><p>\n<b>Days 9–12 — Cruise &amp; Explore Svalbard</b></p><p>\nWe will travel along the same routes as famous polar explorers such as Andrée, Nordenskjöld, Amundsen and Nobile. We will visit walrus haul-outs, might see reindeer, and maybe even spot the Arctic fox or bearded seal. Northern Fulmars will be our constant companions. We might even encounter a few whales. Several species frequent the area, in particular Minke and beluga.\n</p><p>\nOur flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of favourable ice and weather conditions. Whether cruising by Zodiac amongst ice floes and icebergs or heading ashore for a guided walk, our adventures will bring us up close to mystical settings. Each day our Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on changing weather, ice conditions and the wildlife we encounter. Here are a few of the places we hope to visit:</p><p> \n\n-Hornsund – This is the southernmost fjord on the rugged west coast of Spitsbergen Island. Jagged mountain peaks tower above glacier-filled bays. Amidst floating icebergs, we will watch for bearded seals, the beluga whale and the king of the Arctic – the polar bear. Sightings are fairly common as the polar bear’s favourite food, the ringed seal, breeds in the fjord. The surrounding bird cliffs are home to thousands of pairs of nesting Little Auks. We may visit the remains of whaling stations and trappers’ huts. </p><p>\n\n-Fjortende Julibreen – The 14th of July Bay is located at the entrance of Krossfjorden. Here we will go ashore for a hike up to the 14th of July Glacier –conditions permitting, we will climb onto the glacier, or, alternatively walk to the Hanging Gardens, a beautiful plant oasis underneath a bird cliff.\n</p><p>\n-Ice Cruising – With the strengthened hull of the Silver Cloud, we have the perfect platform to search for walrus and polar bears as we devote at least one day to exploring the pack ice north of Spitsbergen. Conditions permitting, our Expedition Leader may choose to take us out in the Zodiacs for an even closer look.\n</p><p>\n-Liefdefjorden – At the entrance to Liefdefjorden are several small island groups. On the Andøyane (Duck Islands) we may encounter polar bears looking for bird’s eggs. With our Zodiacs we might circumnavigate several of the islands, always on the lookout for active birdlife –when Arctic Terns circle specific areas it usually is a sign for polar bear presence on the islands. </p><p>\n\n-Monacobreen – Cruising past majestic red Devonian sandstone mountains we will reach the end of Liefdefjorden for a Zodiac cruise along the front of two different glaciers: Monacobreen and Seligerbreen. Monacobreen has a 5 kilometre long front and is a good place to look for seals, Black-legged Kittiwakes and Ivory Gulls.</p><p>\n\n-Magdalenefjorden – Found on Spitsbergen’s northwest coast, Magdalenefjorden was already seen by Willem Barents in 1596. Walrus was hunted here in later days and a whaling station was set up. The remains of blubber ovens and a cemetery can still be seen. Silver Cloud will enter this scenic fjord in Northwest Spitsbergen National Park and we might land at Graveneset for a short walk.\n\n</p><p><b>Day 13 — Longyearbyen, Svalbard</b>\n</p><p>After breakfast, disembark <i>Silver Cloud.\n</i></p><p><i>\nExpedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

On the island is Harstad, our port-of-call for the afternoon and North Norway’s third-largest town. The annual North Norwegian Festival of Culture takes place during the last week of June and we hope to see and hear some of it during our visit. </p><p>\n\nThe surrounding area has mountains, fjords, island, forests and many hiking trails. Harstad has (surprisingly) Scandinavia’s most unusual waterpark –located inside a mountain! North of Harstad is the Trondenes Historical Centre and the world’s northernmost medieval stone church –as well as one of the Atlantic Wall guns set up during WWII.\n</p><p>In the afternoon we will explore the town, the Historical Centre and offer hikes.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 9 — Tysfjord, Norway</b>\n</p><p>The morning will be used to explore the area of Tysfjord by land or Zodiac. A long hike might lead to a gigantic waterfalls, while others might simply walk up to a beautiful cascade in this “alpine” area. This is the narrowest part of Norway and was formerly used by Sami reindeer herders of Sweden and Norway.\n</p><p>\nDuring the afternoon <i>Silver Cloud</i> will sail south, giving lecturers time to expand on Norway’s natural history.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 10 — Nordfjord and Melfjord, Norway</b>\n</p><p>Nordfjord and Melfjord are part of the very scenic county of Nordland. Silver Cloud will cruise along the picturesque fjords with their lush slopes. Occasionally waterfalls will tumble down over the smooth rocks. The Svartisen National Park extends to the bottom of Nordfjorden, a branch of the Melfjord. Svartisen is one of the largest icecaps of the Norwegian mainland. The shoreline forms part of the border of the national park with dense birch forests in the fjord’s valleys. Hikes might be offered to a viewpoint above the fjord and Zodiac cruises closer along the shore. The narrow fjords with their steep mountainsides are impressive to see from sea level.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 11 — Vega Archipelago, Norway</b>\n</p><p>The Vega Archipelago, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is a myriad of islands scattered in the \nNorwegian Sea and home to one of Norway’s largest eider duck colony. Of the 6,000 Vega islands, 59 were once inhabited by families that made their living from fishing and from eider down harvesting. Today, there are no year-round residents, but the population returns in the summer to continue the 1,500-year-old tradition of caring for the eider ducks and harvesting their precious down. The eider ducks return to their breeding ground in the Vega Archipelago every year and lay their eggs from May into June. In the fishing harbor of Nes, we will visit the Eider Duck Museum, which provides insight into the islander's unique traditions as guardians of these birds and describes the process of producing eiderdown duvets. Nearby exhibitions detail the archipelago's UNESCO status and document the history of Lånan – the largest egg and eiderdown farm in Helgeland. Before returning to the pier we will stop in at the Coastal Museum to have a look at their motor collection and later make a brief visit to see the Vega Church in Gladstad, a wooden church dating from 1864.\n\n</p><p><b>Day 12 — Storfjord, Sunnylvsfjord and Geiranger, Norway</b>\n</p><p>On our approach to Geiranger we will cruise Storfjorden. South of the village of Helsem the large fjord branches towards the east and the south. The 26-kilometre (16 mi) long Sunnylvsfjord to the south is one of the innermost branches of Storfjord. The fjord ranges from 600 to 2,000 metres (2,000 to 6,600 ft.) wide and the fjord reaches 452 metres (1,483 ft.) below sea level at its deepest point. The famous Geirangerfjord branches off to the west from the Sunnylvsfjord. </p><p>\nOf Norway’s many fjords, Geirangerfjord is doubtless the most beautiful. Impressive mountains, numerous waterfalls as well as farms clinging to the steep hillsides give the fjord its unique character.

Before returning to the pier we will stop in at the Coastal Museum to have a look at their motor collection and later make a brief visit to see the Vega Church in Gladstad, a wooden church dating from 1864. </p><p>\n\n<i>Silver Cloud</i> will then head north to cruise Vistenfjord and the Visten National Park. Much of the park’s bedrock is gneiss, which absorbs very little water, and the water flow in the streams and rivers may vary greatly –causing many cascades and waterfalls to exist. Visten National Park is an incredibly varied wilderness, ranging from fjords to vast forests and towering mountains. There are some trails at the outskirts of the national park, and depending on conditions, we will hike or take our Zodiacs to explore this enchanting area. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 3 — Værøy and Reine, Lofoten Islands, Norway</b>\n</p><p>At the very southern end of the Lofoten Islands are bird cliffs that hold Norway’s largest colony of Atlantic Puffins, and also good numbers of kittiwakes, Razorbills, Black Guillemots, shags, Northern Fulmars and White-tailed Eagles. Storm Petrels and Leach Petrels can be seen from early July onwards. Characteristic shoreline species are Whimbrel, Red-necked Phalarope, Arctic Skua, Turnstone and Arctic Tern. Slightly further north is Værøy, an island with quite a few specialties. A special dog was bred to hunt puffins –the Norwegian Lundehund- while islanders caught the White-tailed Eagles with their hands! We will go ashore in Værøy and offer hikes and might do a Zodiac cruise along the rugged coast.\n</p><p>\n<i>Silver Cloud</i> will continue north just a short distance to reach Reine. This village with only 307 inhabitants was once selected as the most beautiful village of Norway. We will go ashore and explore the village and the area. </p><p> \n\n<b>Day 4 — Tysfjord, Norway</b>\n</p><p>The morning will be used to explore the area of Tysfjord by land or Zodiac. A long hike might lead to a gigantic waterfalls, while others might simply walk up to a beautiful cascade in this “alpine” area. This is the narrowest part of Norway and was formerly used by Sami reindeer herders of Sweden and Norway.\n\n</p><p><b>Day 5 — Gjesværstappan Islands, Norway</b>\n</p><p>During the morning <i>Silver Cloud</i> will head for the Gjesværstappan Nature Reserve –one of Europe’s most accessible and largest nesting areas for Atlantic seabirds. In the late morning Silver Cloud will anchor off the Gjesværstappan Islands. We will use our Zodiacs to circumnavigate Storstappen, the largest of the islands, looking for European Shags, Common and Brünnich’s Guillemots, Black-legged Kittiwakes, White-tailed Sea-eagles and Europe’s largest Atlantic Puffin colony. </p><p>\n\nIn the evening <i>Silver Cloud </i>will sail north, rounding North Cape with its impressive cliffs.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 6 — Kirkenes, Norway</b>\n</p><p>Once we arrive in Kirkenes –the end of the famous Hurtigruten-Coastal/Postal service- one option will be to drive southward into the Pasvik Valley sitting between Russia and Finland. There we can go for nature walks to observe the valley’s unique birds and plants. The Pasvik Valley is one of the last wilderness areas in Europe and has Norway’s highest concentration of brown bears. The tour also includes a visit to Høyde 96, a former military observation tower dating from the Cold War affording good views of the Pasvik Valley.\n</p><p>\nAnother option might be heading west along Munkefjord to visit Neiden, a small village near the Finnish/Norwegian border, and see Neiden church, St. George’s Chapel, and the Neiden Waterfall -and even briefly cross into Finland at Näätämö.\n</p><p>\nIn the afternoon, as <i>Silver Cloud</i> sails through the Barents Sea towards Bear Island, a series of lectures will emphasise the special history and natural history of Norway’s Far North. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 7 — Bear Island (Bjørnøya), Norway</b>\n</p><p>Coming up to Bear Island head out on deck to watch for whales -white-beaked dolphins and minke whales are known to frequent the area.\nDuring the morning a special AECO Briefing will be given. This briefing concerns Arctic regulations that outline the environmental policies we must all adhere to in order to enjoy the privilege of visiting this pristine region at the top of the world of which Bear Island is part.\n</p><p>\nAs we near the southern tip of this arctic island, now a nature reserve, we will see thousands of seabirds diving into and out of the island’s steep cliffs. With our Zodiacs and favourable weather conditions, we will explore the rugged coastline. Close to 9 kilometres of cliffs are home to some of the largest bird colonies of the Northern Hemisphere. Common Guillemots, Brünnich’s Guillemots, Black-legged Kittiwakes, Northern Fulmars, and Glaucous Gulls are all found along the cliff. Other species have been observed, including Atlantic Puffins and Northern Gannets. Of the more than 120 species registered, slightly more than 30 actually breed on the island. The Expedition Team will provide insights into the environment, the terrain, and the wildlife that exist in these extreme conditions. </p><p>\n\n<b>Days 8 - 12 — Cruise &amp; Explore Svalbard</b>\n</p><p>Our flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of favourable ice and weather conditions. Whether cruising by Zodiac amongst ice floes and icebergs or heading ashore for a guided walk, our adventures will bring us up close to mystical settings. Each day our Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on changing weather, ice conditions and the wildlife we encounter. We will travel to see walrus haul-outs, might see reindeer, and maybe spot an Arctic fox or a bearded seal. Northern Fulmars will be our constant companions. We might even encounter a few whales. Several species frequent the area, in particular Minke and beluga.\nHere are a few of the places we hope to visit: </p><p>\n\n-Hornsund – This is the southernmost fjord on the rugged west coast of Spitsbergen Island. Jagged mountain peaks tower above glacier-filled bays. Amidst floating icebergs, we will watch for bearded seals, the beluga whale and the king of the Arctic – the polar bear. Sightings are fairly common as the polar bear’s favourite food, the ringed seal, breeds in the fjord. The surrounding bird cliffs are home to thousands of pairs of nesting Little Auks. We may visit the remains of whaling stations and trappers’ huts. </p><p>\n\n-Magdalenefjorden – Found on Spitsbergen’s northwest coast, Magdalenefjorden was already seen by Willem Barents in 1596. Walrus was hunted here in later days and a whaling station was set up. The remains of blubber ovens and a cemetery can still be seen. Silver Cloud will enter this scenic fjord in Northwest Spitsbergen National Park and we might land at Graveneset for a short walk.</p><p>\n\n-Ice Cruising – With the strengthened hull of the Silver Cloud, we have the perfect platform to search for walrus and polar bears as we devote at least one day to exploring the pack ice north of Spitsbergen. Conditions permitting, our Expedition Leader may choose to take us out in the Zodiacs for an even closer look.\n\n</p><p>-Liefdefjorden – At the entrance to Liefdefjorden are several small island groups. On the Andøyane (Duck Islands) we may encounter polar bears looking for bird’s eggs. With our Zodiacs we might circumnavigate several of the islands, always on the lookout for active birdlife –when Arctic Terns circle specific areas it usually is a sign for polar bear presence on the islands. </p><p>\n\n-Monacobreen – Cruising past majestic red Devonian sandstone mountains we will reach the end of Liefdefjorden for a Zodiac cruise along the front of two different glaciers: Monacobreen and Seligerbreen. Monacobreen has a 5 kilometre long front and is a good place to look for seals, Black-legged Kittiwakes and Ivory Gulls.</p><p>\n\n-Fjortende Julibreen – The 14th of July Bay is located at the entrance of Krossfjorden. Here we will go ashore for a hike up to the 14th of July Glacier –conditions permitting, we will climb onto the glacier, or, alternatively walk to the Hanging Gardens, a beautiful plant oasis underneath a bird cliff.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 13 — Longyearbyen, Norway</b>\n</p><p>After breakfast, disembark <i>Silver Cloud.</i></p><p><i>\n</i></p><p><br /><!-- EndFragment --></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"mso-ansi-language:EN-GB\"><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here\nare possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

Walrus was hunted here in later days and a whaling station was set up. The remains of blubber ovens and a cemetery can still be seen. Silver Cloud will enter this scenic fjord in Northwest Spitsbergen National Park and we might land at Graveneset for a short walk.\n</p><p>\n-Monacobreen – Cruising past majestic red Devonian sandstone mountains we will reach the end of Liefdefjorden for a Zodiac cruise along the front of two different glaciers: Monacobreen and Seligerbreen. Monacobreen has a 5 kilometre long front and is a good place to look for seals, Black-legged Kittiwakes and Ivory Gulls.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 8 — Cruising the Greenland Sea</b>\n</p><p>Our Expedition Team members will recap our experiences in Svalbard in the Lecture Theatre and will prepare you for the island of Jan Mayen. Other onboard diversions include spa treatments, a workout in the Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 9 — Jan Mayen, Norway</b>\n</p><p>During the morning we intend to go ashore close to the Norwegian Meteorological Station. Apart from a nature walk leading up to the long black sandy beach on the eastern shore, we will enter the station in small groups and will hear about the work this remote outpost is conducting.\n</p><p>\nIn the afternoon we continue sailing south. As we make our way toward Iceland, head out on deck to watch for seabirds and whales. When not attending an informative lecture, take some time to peruse the well-stocked Library, enjoy a fine cognac in the Connoisseur’s Corner or indulge in any of the other special amenities offered aboard ship.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 10 — Grimsey, Iceland</b>\n</p><p>Just off the north coast of Iceland –and slightly above the Arctic Circle- is Iceland’s northernmost inhabited island. The island is small enough (only 5.3 km²) to be explored on foot and you are bound to meet one of the seventy hardy souls that make this island their home. The island’s sheer cliffs are home to huge seabird colonies, mainly Atlantic Puffins, Black-legged Kittiwakes, Northern Fulmars, Razorbills, and Common and Brünnich’s Guillemots. Still today the islanders abseil down the cliffs to collect bird eggs. You will have the opportunity to visit with islanders to get a first-hand impression of life on Grimsey.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 11 — Akureyri, Iceland</b>\n</p><p>As we reach the mainland, we will get the choice of three different glimpses of Iceland: you can either focus on coastal culture, the beautiful seaside surroundings and visiting small fishing villages and the award-winning Siglufjordur Herring Museum, Iceland’s largest maritime museum, or you could instead look at the countryside culture, visiting small countryside churches, an Icelandic farm and seeing how life is when it is largely based on traditional livestock raising. The third choice would be to taste local delicacies on the mainland and on the small island of Hrisey. You will taste fresh and salted cod and get to see Iceland’s first micro-brewery –and of course can taste the local beer.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 12 — Isafjordur and Vigur Island, Iceland</b>\n</p><p>Isafjordur has a well-preserved town centre from the 19th century and you can accompany a local guide dressed in 19th century clothing to see and hear what makes this place so special. You could also drive to Sudavik and the largest fjord of the Westfjords. The Arctic Fox Centre, a research centre, museum and coffee shop in one, is located there and you will have Icelandic live music at Sudavik’s beautiful and history-charged church. For those interested in horse-back riding, a small number of Icelandic ponies will be there to take you through the Sandar Valley, a 40-minute drive from Isafjordur.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Reykjavik, Iceland</b>\n</p><p>Embark the <i>Silver Cloud</i> and depart on your exciting 9-day Silversea Expedition – “In the Wake of Viking Longships”. After settling into your suite and attending a safety drill we will be setting sail. Meet the members of your Expedition Team in the Lecture Theatre and attend the first of many memorable dinners in one of the restaurants.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 2 — At Sea</b> </p><p>Crossing the Denmark Strait\nSpend the day crossing the Denmark Strait, which connects the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. Meet some of your fellow explorers, attend a Zodiac briefing and learn about the rules and regulations for going ashore in the Arctic. Above all relax and become acquainted with the luxurious amenities found on board the <i>Silver Cloud</i>. Tonight, we invite you to attend a special Welcome Aboard cocktail party where the Captain will introduce his senior officers. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 3 — Skoldungen Fjord (Thrym Glacier)</b>\n</p><p>Cruising along Greenland’s rugged eastern coast, the Silver Cloud explores the Skoldungen Fjord. We will spend much of the day out on deck to take in the scenery: towering mountains tipped with snow, ice-scraped valley sides and sculptured icebergs in shades of white and blue. Upon arriving at the top of the fjord where we can easily see the retreating state of the Thrym Glacier, we will have our first Zodiac cruise of the journey, allowing us to explore this picturesque setting from a unique, up-close perspective.\n</p><p> \nOn our return journey, exiting this U-shaped fjord, join the Expedition Team out on deck to marvel at the spectacular scenery and to look for humpback whales and orcas, frequently seen at the entrance of the fjord.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 4 — Cruise and Explore Prince Christian Sund and Aappilattoq, Greenland</b></p><p>\nOur plan for today is to explore one of South Greenland’s most dramatic natural features: Prince Christian Sund. On either side of the Silver Cloud, waterfalls stream down sharp, wrinkled mountainsides as we navigate the fjord through a sea of icebergs that glitter in the sun. Born of compacted ancient snows that calve into the sound at the glacier’s edge, each iceberg is different from the next. Time and weather conditions permitting, we plan to set out via the Zodiacs to explore even more. \nIn the afternoon, and shortly before leaving the sound, we will visit the small settlement of Aappilattoq. You can walk through the village and climb a nearby hill for excellent views of the sound and the mountains. </p><p>\n \n<b>Day 5 — Nanortalik and  Uunartoq Island, Greenland</b>\n</p><p>Nanortalik lies in a scenic area surrounded by steep mountainsides and is Greenland’s most southerly town. The town’s name means the “place of polar bears”, which refers to the polar bears that used to be seen floating offshore on summer’s ice floes. Nanortalik has an excellent open-air museum that gives a broad picture of the region from Inuit times to today. At the summer hunting camp, Inuit in traditional clothing will describe aspects of their ancestor’s customs and lifestyle including an impressive kayak demonstration. Time permitting we will enjoy the tradition of kaffe-mik (coffee and cake) and a folk dancing presentation at the Cultural Centre.\n</p><p>\nIn the afternoon, the Silver Cloud will drop anchor at Uunartoq. Since the days of the Norse, the hot springs here have been renowned for their healing effects. Take this opportunity to relax and unwind in steaming waters. It is quite an experience to be in the hot spring and see icebergs float by. Remember to pack swimwear! Condition permitting we will offer a Zodiac cruise past some of the icebergs north of Uunartoq.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 6 — Qaqortoq and  Hvalsey, Greenland</b>\n</p><p>This morning we arrive at the picturesque harbour town of Qaqortoq. The town’s name translates to ‘white place’, but today, instead of snow, we will admire the hillsides of colourful houses painted in bright primary shades. Our local guides will take us to the charming town square, home to Greenland’s oldest fountain built in 1928. Surrounding it are two churches, one old and one new, an open-air fish and meat market, and the Qaqortoq Museum. This modest museum houses a superb collection of historical artefacts associated with Inuit hunting and fishing, a whaler’s gun and a collection of contemporary artwork.</p><p> \n\nIn the afternoon the Silver Cloud anchors off Hvalsey. Once ashore, we will learn how Christianity spread its influence throughout Europe and eventually reached remote Greenland, where it established itself in the country in 1000 AD. Hvalsey Church was built in the 14th century and is the best preserved of the churches in Greenland from that period. Together we will visit the church and other historical ruins from the time of the Vikings.\n\n</p><p><b>Day&nbsp;7 — Qassiarsuk and Ittileq, Greenland</b> </p><p>\nEncircled by a wealth of Norse ruins, Qassiarsuk (or Brattahlid) is where we begin our day. Qassiarsuk is the newer, Greenlandic name for this small village. Brattahlid is the older, Norse name. Here we tour the foundation remains of the manor house of Erik the Red, who found Greenland after being banished from Iceland and Norway for murder. We will also visit the site of the first Christian church ever built in North America (physiographically speaking), see a recently unearthed Norse graveyard that contains remains of 144 Norse colonists, and have a chance to admire Hans Lynge’s remarkable bronze sculpture of Erik the Red.\n</p><p>\nBack aboard the <i>Silver Cloud</i>, we enjoy lunch as the ship cruises to Ittileq. From our landing site, we will walk the 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) to Igaliku where we will meet up with the 30 inhabitants, who are very proud of their beautiful village. With our local guides we will visit the ruins of Garðar, which was once the religious heart of 12th-century Norse Greenland. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 8 — At sea</b> </p><p>\nOur Expedition Team members will present informative topics to prepare you for Nuuk, its museum and the special treasures it houses. \nBinoculars and camera in hand, you can also head out on deck to watch and to identify the seabirds that might follow our passage. Relax in the Spa or try the Gym for some exercises.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 9 — Nuuk, Greenland</b>\n</p><p>This morning we arrive in Greenland’s first town (1728) and current capital, Nuuk, which means “the heartland”. </p><p>\n\nOur leisurely walk through this picturesque harbour town allows us to take in Nuuk’s natural beauty, and also to see Inuit ruins, Hans Egede’s home, parliament, and the Church of our Saviour. At the Greenlandic National Museum we have the fantastic opportunity to see the famous Qilakitsoq mummies. \n\nThis afternoon our onboard Photographer/Videographer is going to show the Voyage-DVD, highlighting the many aspects of our voyage along Greenland’s East and West coast. Before turning in for the night, take a stroll on deck to take in the solitude of the vast sea and sky, hopefully glimpsing the Aurora Borealis.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 10 — Kangerlussuaq, Greenland</b> </p><p>\nAfter breakfast, disembark the <i>Silver Cloud</i> and transfer to the airport for your flight home.\n</p><p>\n<i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Kangerlussuaq, Greenland</b>\n</p><p>Enjoy your first Zodiac-ride to<i> Silver Cloud</i>, waiting at anchor. Once all guests have embarked, a safety briefing will be conducted and we will depart on our exciting Silversea Expedition -“High Arctic Explorer”.\n\n</p><p>This evening, you will be introduced to your Expedition Leader and the Expedition Team and attend a Zodiac briefing. While we cruise the 100-mile-long Kangerlussuaq Fjord keep an eye for Peregrine Falcon, as this fjord is home to 130 pairs.\n</p><p>\t\n<b>Day 2 — Sisimiut, Greenland</b>\n</p><p>Located just north of the Arctic Circle, Sisimiut is the northernmost town in Greenland where the port remains free of ice in the winter. Yet it is also the southernmost town where there exists enough snow and ice to drive a dogsled in winter and spring. In Sisimiut, travelling by sled has been the primary means of winter transportation for centuries. You will see many dogs in town and we hope to meet the owner of a sled dog team and his dogs. He will tell us all about sledding and how the Greenlandic sled dog has been bred to be amongst the strongest working dogs in the world.\n</p><p>\nA nice hike around the town and into the outskirts will be offered. Stroll through the Sisimiut Museum with its 18th century wooden buildings and see some of the local handicraft, featuring native stonework and sealskin garments. </p><p>\n\t\n<b>Day 3 —\tUummannaq, Greenland</b>\n</p><p>In the iceberg-laden waters surrounding the remote community of Uummannaq it is common to see whales, so be sure to join the Expedition Team out on deck during our approach. This area of Greenland is known for its huge basalt mountains, and this small hunting and fishing village rests at the foot of the heart-shaped Uummannaq Mountain, a name that translates to mean “in the shape of a seal’s heart”. Together we will take a guided walking tour of Uummannaq to see the granite church. Perhaps we will have a chance to listen to the local choir. During the walk we will learn how village life revolves around the halibut/fish-processing factory. The more energetic will have the opportunity to hike to what is known as the “summer residence of Santa Claus”.\n</p><p>\t\t\n<b>Day 4 — Cruising Baffin Bay</b> </p><p>\nParticipate in discussions and onboard activities led by the Expedition Team, relax ing one of the lounges with that book you’ve been meaning to read, and meet up with new friends for cocktails. On board Silver Cloud, a variety of diversions are available, including lectures, spa treatments, a workout in the Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences. Before turning in for the night, take a stroll on deck to take in the solitude of the vast sea and sky.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 5 — Pond Inlet, Nunavut, Canada</b>\n</p><p>Located in northern Baffin Island, Pond Inlet is a small, predominantly Inuit community with a population of roughly 1500 inhabitants. In 1818 the British explorer John Ross named a bay in the vicinity after an English astronomer and today Pond Inlet is considered one of Canada's \"jewels of the North\". Several glaciers and mountain ranges nearby make this one of the most picturesque communities. </p><p>\n\nMany archaeological sites of ancient Dorset and Thule peoples can be found near Pond Inlet. The Inuit had long hunted caribou, ringed and harp seals, fish, polar bears, walrus, narwhals, geese, ptarmigans and arctic hares, before European and American whalers came here to hunt bowhead whales.\nPond Inlet is known as a major center of Inuit art, especially printmaking and stone carving. View a variety of techniques and styles used in creating these unique pieces in the galleries in town. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 6 — Buchan Gulf, Nunavut, Canada</b>\n</p><p>Located in the northern part of Baffin Island, Buchan Gulf is an Important Bird Area with many Northern Fulmars nesting there. The area has several connecting fjords and spectacular scenery. In the water narwhal and walrus have been seen –and polar bears are frequent visitors too. A tundra walk can be challenging, as the surrounding area consists of dense, spongy, thick moss carpets and might be boggy. There are several ancient Thule semi-subterranean winter home sites found in the area.\t</p><p>\t\n\n<b>Day 7 — Sirmilik National Park, Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada</b>\n</p><p>Found at the northern end of Baffin Island, Bylot Island runs 180 km from east to west and 110 km from north to south. Bylot is one of the largest uninhabited islands in the world. Vertical cliffs and numerous glaciers are found along the shore of Bylot Island. Polar bears are known to den here, while beluga and bowhead whales, narwhal and harp seals, as well as ringed seals frequent the area.\n</p><p>\nThe Sirmilik National Park covers much of this area and harbours large populations of Thick-billed Murres (Brünnich’s Guillemots) and Black-legged Kittiwakes which we intend to see. The importance this area has for birds is shown in its designation as Important Bird Area (actually three different ones) and Bylot Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary. The southwest corner of Bylot Island’s southern end has moist lowland tundra that is ideal nesting habitat for waterfowl, shorebirds and songbirds -and more than 70 different species of birds can be found on Bylot Island. Canada’s largest breeding colony of Greater Snow Geese in the Canadian High Arctic is on this island.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 8— Cruise Peel Sound, Nunavut, Canada</b>\n</p><p><i>Silver Cloud</i> will cruise between Somerset Island and Prince of Wales Island in the Peel Sound. We will be following the track of two famous expeditions of the mid-19th century: Sir James Franklin’s and James Clark Ross’. The ice conditions will dictate how far the ship can go and we will look for polar bears on the ice and might take to the Zodiacs to get a closer look. \t\n\n</p><p><b>Day 9 — Beechey Island and Radstock Bay, Devon Island, Nunavut, Canada</b>\n</p><p><i>Silver Cloud </i>will anchor in front of Beechey Island. Fringed by a narrow beach, windswept and barren, Beechey Island is associated with the tragic Franklin Expedition looking for the Northwest Passage. Three graves of members of the expedition as well as a cairn and some small buildings were found here during the search for the survivors of the expedition. Parts of Northumberland House, a supply depot and emergency shelter dating back to the 1850s and the Belcher Expedition, can still be seen on the island today. </p><p>\n\nWe will go ashore to have a look at the remains of Franklin’s unfortunate stop and a monument that has been erected in memory of those who had perished on that expedition.\n</p><p>\nDuring lunch <i>Silver Cloud</i> will reposition to Devon Island. This is Canada’s sixth largest island and was first seen by Europeans in the early 17th century. The Thule culture had already settled there many centuries before and we will be looking for Thule qarmat homes. Other striking finds in this area are the many fossils of corals, crinoids and nautiloids that can be seen. Our team of experts will be leading and guiding you, looking for remains of the Thule, and the fossils -and for wildlife, as just across Lancaster Sound is Prince Leopold Island, a Canadian Important Bird Area, a federally listed migratory bird sanctuary, and a Key Migratory Bird Terrestrial Habitat site with large numbers of Thick-billed Murres, Northern Fulmars and Black-legged Kittiwakes breeding there between June and September.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 10 — Dundas Harbour, Devon Island, Nunavut, Canada</b>\n</p><p>Our second landing on Devon Island takes us ashore to the abandoned settlement of Dundas Harbour, called Talluruti in Inuktitut. Together we will explore the expanses of barren tundra while our onboard Historian might describe the various attempts to settle the area over the years. In 1924 a Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment was established at Dundas Harbour. Three constables were stationed here to watch over the entrance into the famous Lancaster Sound—the gateway to the much sought after Northwest Passage. The remains of their outpost can still be seen. Birders will hope to see the Rough-legged Hawks that nest on the cliffs and we might catch a glimpse of grazing muskoxen.\t</p><p>\n\t\n<b>Day 11 — Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada</b>\n</p><p>With more than 196,000 km² Ellesmere Island is Canada’s third-largest and northernmost island. The Quttinirpaaq National Park makes up more than one-fifth of the island. Polar bears, arctic wolves, arctic foxes, ermines, muskoxen, Peary caribou, arctic hares, and collared lemmings are typical animals found on Ellesmere. In the waters we will look for ringed seal, bearded seal, and narwhal. Rare but not entirely impossible would be sightings of harp seal, harbour seal, and beluga, bowhead and killer whales.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 12 — At Sea, crossing Baffin Bay</b> </p><p>\nParticipate in onboard activities, attend a lecture by a member of the Expedition Team, or simply be on the lookout for wildlife this far north. A spa treatment, a visit to the Sauna, a workout in the Fitness Centre, there are many choices of how you want to spend the day. In the evening enjoy another special dining experience. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 13 — Upernavik, Greenland</b>\n</p><p>This afternoon, as we continue our exploration, we stop at Upernavik, one of the few settlements along the northern part of West Greenland. During our visit we will have a look at the local museum and stroll through the brightly coloured village.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 14 — Disko Island, Greenland</b>\n</p><p>During the morning Silver Cloud will ply the Disko Bay en route to our destination along Disko Island’s east coast. Our exploration of the Disko Bay area will head to an area north of the village of Qeqertarsuaq, which is named after Disko Island’s local name –meaning “large island”. With more than 3,300 sq. miles Disko Island is Greenland’s second-largest island. We hope to offer tundra walks and will enjoy a Zodiac tour of the rugged coastline and the many icebergs that get stranded here after breaking off from the Jakobshavn Glacier.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 15 — Ilulissat, Greenland (UNESCO World Heritage Site)</b>\n</p><p>Just after sunrise, be out on deck to see the fjord of the northern hemisphere’s most active glacier – Jakobshavn – often surrounded by icebergs in all shapes and sizes and in varying shades of white and turquoise. Known as the birthplace of icebergs, the Ilulissat Icefjord produces nearly 35 km³ of ice each year. While here, we may have the opportunity to see a demonstration of ancient fishing methods and enjoy some locally caught and prepared fish. During our guided walking tour of Ilulissat, we will visit the local history museum, located in the former home of Greenlandic folk hero and famed polar explorer Knud Rasmussen. Another tour continues via fishing boat, as we navigate amongst the many icebergs at the fjord’s entrance. </p><p>\n\nAlternatively, guests have the option to purchase an exciting helicopter excursion to see the magnificent Jakobshavn Icefjord by air (seats are limited).\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 16 — At Sea</b> </p><p>\nParticipate in final discussions and attend lectures that recapture our experiences in Greenland and the Canadian Far North. Take time to go through your pictures and to edit them, but definitely you want to attend our Videographer’s presentation of our journey. \nTonight our Captain would like to invite you to the Farewell Cocktail and Farewell Dinner.\n</p><p>\t\t\n<b>Day 17 — Kangerlussuaq, Greenland</b> </p><p>\nAfter breakfast, disembark <i>Silver Cloud</i> via Zodiac.\n</p><p>\n<i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

Known as the birthplace of icebergs, the Ilulissat Icefjord produces several million tons of ice each day. Its entrance is often surrounded by icebergs in all shapes and sizes and in varying shades of white and turquoise. </p>\n<p>The town of Ilulissat is known for its long periods of calm and settled weather, but the climate is a bit colder due to its proximity to the fjord. While here, we may have the opportunity to see a demonstration of ancient fishing methods and enjoy some locally caught and prepared fish. During our guided walking tour of Ilulissat, we will visit the local history museum, which used to be the home of famous arctic explorer Knud Rasmussen. South of town are several trails leading to the Icefjord, one of them a boardwalk.</p>\n<p>We will also navigate amongst the many icebergs at the fjord’s entrance in local fishing boats getting amazing views and impressions. </p>\n<p>Alternatively, guests have the option to purchase an exciting helicopter excursion to see the magnificent Jakobshavn Icefjord by air.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 4 — Sisimiut, Greenland</strong><br />\n  Located just north of the Arctic Circle, Sisimiut is the second-largest as well as the northernmost town in Greenland where the port remains free of ice in the winter. Yet it is also the southernmost town where there exists enough snow and ice to drive a dogsled in winter and spring. The Greenlandic sled dog has been bred to be amongst the strongest working dogs in the world and can be seen all over town.</p>\n<p>  Sisimiut has been used by different cultures and groups for almost 4500 years. Ruins of early settlements can still be seen west of the town. The Sisimiut Museum houses part of its collection in Greenland’s oldest surviving church as well as in a peat house. For those interested in tasting some of the local delicacies, the museum has prepared Greenlandic soup, shrimps, and dried fish which you can taste while visiting the museum.</p>\n<p>Another typical and iconic ‘vehicle’ of transportation in the Arctic is the qajaq (better known as ‘kayak’) and although most Greenlandic hunters or fishermen use modern boats, many still have a qajaq. We hope to see a qajaq demonstration in Sisimiut’s harbour.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Nuuk, Greenland</strong><br />\n  This morning we arrive in Greenland’s first town (1728) and current capital, Nuuk -“the heartland”.</p>\n<p>  We will have ample time to explore one of the smallest capitals in the world. Our leisurely walk through this picturesque harbour town allows us to take in Nuuk’s natural beauty, and also to see Inuit ruins, Hans Egede’s home, parliament, and the Church of our Saviour. At the Greenlandic National Museum we have the fantastic opportunity to see an outstanding collection of traditional hunting gear, art, colourful traditional clothing and the famous Qilakitsoq mummies.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Cruising the Davis Strait<br />\n  </strong>Binoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to watch for seabirds and marine mammals. Attend informative lectures that will prepare you for the upcoming ports-of-call in Canada and the adventures that lie ahead. Peruse an array of titles and topics in the well-stocked Library, enjoy a fine cognac at the Connoisseur’s Corner or indulge in any of the other special amenities offered aboard <em>Silver Cloud</em>. <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>Day 7 — Iqaluit, Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada</strong><br />\n  Our first foray into Canada begins in the town of Iqaluit, located at the head of Frobisher Bay, an inlet of the North Atlantic extending into south-eastern Baffin Island. The Bay is so long that it was first taken to be the possible entrance of a Northwest Passage. Iqaluit is the capital of Canada’s newest territory, Nunavut -Inuktitut for “our land”. Nunavut is the least populated, but largest of Canada’s provinces and territories.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\nAfter completing formalities associated with customs and immigration, we go ashore and explore the edges of Canada’s “true north”. Depending on the tides (Iqaluit has a maximum tidal range of almost 12 metres) we will either have a dry landing on a pier or a wet beach landing.</p>\n<p>Our ship’s experts along with local guides will take us around Iqaluit and will lead us through the Nunatta Sunakkutaangit Museum and the Nunavut Legislative Assembly Building, both housing incredible collections of Inuit artwork. The museum shop has some very interesting local prints for sale. Even walking through town there are many opportunities to see various pieces of artwork.</p>\n<p>We will also visit the Silvia Grinnell Territorial Park west of Iqaluit for walks and hikes.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 —</strong> <strong>Lady Franklin Island and Monumental Island, Nunavut, Canada</strong><br />\n  Named in honour of Sir John Franklin’s widow, uninhabited Lady Franklin Island&nbsp;is 40&nbsp;kilometres off of Baffin Island’s&nbsp;Hall Peninsula. There are at least seven smaller, unnamed islands off its northwest shore that lend themselves to be explored by Zodiac, while Lady Franklin Island offers an abundance of bears, ducks, seals, and walrus.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 —</strong> <strong>Kimmirut, Nunavut, Canada</strong><br />\n  This morning you might want to attend a lecture about Northern Art, and find out how and why the Inuit took to art. <em>Silver Cloud</em> will arrive in Kimmirut, a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police post and Hudson Bay Company trading centre, in the late morning. </p>\n<p>The terrain of Kimmirut is among the oldest on the planet, sitting on a variety of metamorphic rock formations and the village receives its name from a prominent rock feature. Kimmirut’s harbor has very powerful tides, with water levels varying by as much as 11 metres (36 feet). </p>\n<p>We visit this village to see the local arts and crafts. The Kimmirut artists blend regional styles and locally available materials. The most predominant kind of art is stone carving, although there is also a tradition of scrimshaw etchings done on walrus ivory. In recent years creating jewelry has become of interest. The material used for this are the semi-precious stones found in the Kimmirut area.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — Kinngait (Cape Dorset), Nunavut, Canada</strong><br />\n  A morning at sea allows us to make good progress towards our next destination and to attend a lecture, seminar or workshop while heading further west towards Kinngait (Cape Dorset).</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Cape Dorset is the most famous Inuit art village in the Canadian North. Here we will visit the printmakers and carvers of the region and even have the option to purchase a special piece as a souvenir of our visit. Travelling across the bay by Zodiac, we can also explore Mallikjuaq Territorial Park where the remains of winter residences from thousands of years ago can be seen. Our local guide will explain in detail the aspects of daily life for his ancestors. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 11 —Kangiqsujuaq, Nunavik, Canada</strong><br />\n  Today we will be in spectacular Wakeham Bay and the area of the small village of Kangiqsujuaq. In line with our search for art, we want to see how the locals interpret the Dorset culture mask petroglyphs found south of the village. Apart from the village visit, tundra walks might be on offer. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — Akpatok Island, Nunavut, Canada</strong><br />\n  Today we explore around remote Akpatok Island at the northernmost extremity of the Labrador Peninsula. Steep and sheer limestone cliffs jut out of the cold waters. Encased in snow and surrounded with sea ice in the winter months, this uninhabited island lures huge amounts of wildlife, most notably the world’s largest population of breeding Thick-billed Murres, also known as Brünnich’s Guillemots (Inuktitut name: <em>Akpatok</em>), estimated at well over a million birds. These auks flock to the bare cliffs of the island between June and September, and incubate their single pear-shaped egg on the cliff’s ledges. Glaucous Gulls can be seen soaring above looking for unguarded eggs and chicks, while Black Guillemots paddle around on the nearby sea. Akpatok Island is also a favourite summer home for polar bears as they wait for the winter ice to form.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 13— Torngat Mountains National Park, Canada&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  On our way south from Akpatok we will be travelling along the Torngat Mountains National Park situated on the eastern side of Labrador’s northernmost point –sometimes described as the “Eastern Rocky Mountains”. Torngat Mountains National Park covers an area of 9.700 km² and is dotted with remnants of several cirque glaciers and has an outstanding array of geological features. The steep cliffs provide some of the best exposures to the earth’s geologic history. Although polar bears can often be seen hunting seals on the ice we are still too early in the season, but herds of Torngat Mountain and George River caribou migrate to and from their calving grounds and Inuit use the area to hunt, fish and travel throughout the park. Red and Arctic foxes will be looking for lemmings and voles. Harlequin Ducks, Peregrine Falcons, Barrow’s Goldeneye and Short-eared Owls are found within the park. While Minke whales tend to linger in bays, humpback and fin whales like to stay offshore.</p>\n<p>South of Torngat Mountains National Park –and permission pending- we would like to visit Hebron, an abandoned Moravian settlement declared a National Historic Site.</p>\n<p><em>Silver Cloud</em> will be following the coastline, looking for the different whales.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14— Cruising the Labrador Sea</strong><br />\n  A leisurely day at sea can be used to exchange notes with fellow travellers. As we make our way along Canada’s scenic coast, spend some time out on deck keeping an eye out for seabirds, dolphin, seals and migrating humpback, fin or blue whales, or listen to additional presentations by our expert natural history staff in the Lecture Theatre or in the comfort of your suite. Enjoy a fine cognac at the Connoisseur’s Corner or indulge in any of the other special amenities offered aboard <em>Silver Cloud</em>. </p>\n<p><strong>Day&nbsp; 15— Twillingate, Canada</strong><br />\n  Twillingate is the self-proclaimed ‘Iceberg Capital of the World’ –although it is highly unlikely that we should see any icebergs at this time of the year.</p>\n<p>Once ashore by Zodiac, you will be taken by local bus to the “Prime Berth Museum” first, which could be well described as a commercial fishing heritage site. You will hear about the glory “salt fish days” before the cod fishery moratorium in the middle of the eighties of the last century let the busy settlement shrink. Afterwards you will visit several historic buildings packed with artefacts near the shoreline. The excursion also goes to the museum, the former house of an Anglican priest, right next to the church. Almost all the objects on display here are from 1900 to the early 1920s –including a giant bicycle from the turn of the century.&nbsp; Afterwards you will have a good view over the Notre Dame Bay and the outer isles at Long Point Lighthouse. </p>\n<p>During the afternoon we will continue on toward St. John’s. Our onboard Videographer will present his voyage-DVD, a good opportunity to recall all the different impressions of Greenland, Baffin Island and the Canadian coast.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 16— St. John’s, Canada</strong><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Cloud.</em></p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — St. John’s, Canada </strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Cloud</em> during the afternoon. Once all guests have embarked, you will attend a mandatory safety drill before we depart on our exciting Silversea Expedition – Voyage around the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This evening, you will be introduced to your Expedition Leaders and attend a mandatory Zodiac briefing. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 —</strong> <strong>L’Anse Aux Meadow, Newfoundland, Canada</strong><br />\n  During the morning enjoy a lecture about the Norse voyages from Greenland to Canada and the sleuthing behind the search for their landing sites while we head northward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  After lunch aboard <em>Silver Cloud </em>we will land like ancient Vikings albeit via Zodiac on the shores of L’Anse aux Meadows (“Jellyfish Bay”). After a short walk with our local guides, we encounter the ruins of an entire Viking village dating back to the year 1000. Norseman Leif Eriksson, son of Erik the Red, established this colony in the New World some 500 years before the likes of Christopher Columbus and John Cabot. In 1978, this village was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Much of the L’Anse aux Meadows’ archaeological site remains natural and unspoilt. Three buildings have been reconstructed near the original site in order to provide visitors insight into the lifestyles of these hardy explorers.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n  <strong>Day 3 —</strong> <strong>Woody Point, Bonne Bay, Gros Morne National Park, Newfoundland, Canada</strong><br />\n  Via Zodiac, we go ashore for a&nbsp;morning&nbsp;of discovery at Gros Morne National Park, where we can actually witness the geological past of our planet. Recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for both exceptional natural scenery and distinctive geological history, Gros Morne National Park&nbsp;provides some of our planet’s great geology lessons.&nbsp;This morning we will step on the earth’s mantle and experience the harsh landform – the Tablelands – that gave the park its World Heritage status. We also learn about the park and Newfoundland at&nbsp;Gros Morne’s Discovery Centre, the primary interpretation centre.&nbsp;Here you can learn more about Newfoundland’s geology, plant and animal life, marine story and human history.</p>\n<p>We will continue to the start of the Tablelands Trail, where your guide will invite you to explore the landform’s unique biology and geology during a 30-minute exploration or you can accompany a guide along the 2½ mile round trip hike to the entrance of Winterhouse Brook Canyon. </p>\n<p>We return to the&nbsp;<em>Silver Cloud</em> and sail for Havre St. Pierre in the afternoon.<br />\n  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 4 — Havre-Saint-Pierre, Quebec, Canada</strong><br />\n  Havre-Saint-Pierre is among the Mingan Islands that lie along the North Shore of the Gulf of St Lawrence on the eastern coast of Quebec. Today we will visit the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, which is devoted to protecting and preserving the ecological integrity of the unique “flowerpot” limestone monoliths. These impressive natural sculptures occur in a thousand and one shapes and sizes on this string of 40 islands. Together with our Expedition Team and local Canada Parks Rangers we hope to see Osprey, Eider Ducks, Atlantic Puffins and various other shore birds. Our onboard Botanist will lead woodland walks, describing the bogs, orchids, insectivorous plants and arctic-alpine flora. The beautiful coastal scenery, cliffs and lakes, will be a delight.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 —</strong> <strong>Bonaventure Island, Canada</strong><br />\n  Today we will visit Bonaventure Island and Percé Rock National Park – home to the largest migratory bird refuge in North America. 223 different species of birds are known from Bonaventure Island and its colony of thousands of Northern Gannets is the most accessible and the largest in size in North America. Without a doubt, the high point of our visit will be the sight of 250,000 birds nesting on the island. The island also offers four hiking trails and a historic heritage trail that reflects Bonaventure Island’s prosperous past. Percé Rock is a massive limestone stack 90 metres wide and 88 metres at its highest. It contains millions of marine fossils from the Devonian period and its arch has a height of 15 metres. Cormorants, gulls and kittiwakes tend to rest on this 433 metres long rock.</p>\n<p>For those not interested in a hike, we can offer a Zodiac cruise along the cliffs.&nbsp;From Bonaventure you will take a ferry across to Percé for a bus transfer to Anse-à-Beaufils. The port and old factory are a meeting point of the historic district of Percé.&nbsp; “La Vielle Usine de l’Anse-à-Beaufils” (the old factory) has been restored and now houses an art gallery, workshop-boutiques, a show hall, café and a terrace. We will visit the Historic General Store and art gallery before attending a “Lobster Fest”. A group of professional regional musicians will play and go around the tables providing entertainment while you feast on lobster, salads, desserts accompanied by tea, coffee, beer and wine.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Île de Madeleine Islands, Canada</strong><br />\n  Located in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, just north of Prince Edward Island, the Magdalen Islands are a group of nine main islands and numerous islets. Magdalen Islanders, who are known for their generous nature, are intimately familiar with their fellow residents, the harp seals. During our visit we will learn about life on this small island beginning with a visit to the Fumoir d’antan smokehouse where we will enjoy a guided tour and tasting. We next visit the Fromagerie Pied de Vent cheese factory that produces artisan raw milk cheese. Crossing the Chemin des Montants, we will discover a small valley and a panoramic view of Havre-aux-Maisons. At the South Dune Beach we will walk underground through amazing red sandstone caves, sculpted naturally by the sea. </p>\n<p>On the north side of the islands, we find Belle Anse with its steep red sandstone cliffs that show the effects of year after year of erosion. Upon arriving at La Côte, we will enjoy some time to browse the boutiques and chat with the local craftsmen and fishermen. Here at the interpretation centre we can also learn how about the raising of mussels and scallops in the lagoon. To conclude our excursion, we head to the Artisans du Sable for a whole new way to look at sand, and then visit the historical meeting place of La Grave that today offers an aquarium, museum of the sea and several boutiques.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 —</strong> <strong>Louisbourg, Nova Scotia, Canada</strong><br />\n  With special permission, we land our Zodiacs directly at the Fortress of Louisbourg, the crown jewel of Canada’s national park service. In the early 1700s, the port of Louisbourg was established by the French, who made extensive fortifications and built long rows of drying racks for salted cod, which were exported as “klipfish”. The fortress was all but destroyed after several battles for control between the French and the British, with the British finally winning out. Today, mounds of grass-covered stone from original foundation walls have been painstakingly transformed to their former 18th-century splendour. The largest historical reconstruction in the nation’s history is now a Canadian National Historic Site.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 —</strong> <strong>Sable Island, Canada</strong><br />\n  Off the coast of Nova Scotia, Sable Island’s history is quite divers including shipwrecks, sealing and walrus hunting. This sandy gulf island has recently become a National Park and Sable Island’s wild horses are world-famous. Free to roam, they represent one of the world’s last wild equine populations. Along the island’s 42 km of beaches, dunes and bogs you’ll find a great variety of plants. Sable Island is mostly unoccupied by humans, with a winter population of 5, but the world’s largest colony of grey seals breeds here, as do the rare Roseate Tern and the endemic Ipswich Sparrow -still, the horses remain the island’s most charismatic residents. Protected as Canada’s 43rd National Park, government permissions pending, we will land with our Zodiacs and parks staff will lead island walking tours on Sable Island.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 — St. Pierre, St. Pierre and Michelon </strong><br />\n  Heading almost due northeast from Sable Island we leave Canada and reach France in less than 16 hours! With barely 6,000 inhabitants living on tiny St. Pierre (10 sq. mi) we are visiting one of the smallest French Overseas collectivities. </p>\n<p>The inhabitants are predominantly descendants of Normans, Basque and Bretons -and the French spoken is closer to Metropolitan French than to Canadian French. Although Basque is not spoken any longer, the influence is still felt through sport and a Basque Festival.</p>\n<p>We will go ashore to have a look at this European enclave. Interestingly, this small island has two museums in part dedicated to the Prohibition and the <em>Musée Heritage</em> is St. Pierre’s newest museum with a focus on medical artefacts from the 19th and 20th century. Another claim to fame is a guillotine, the only one ever used in North America. If you want to send any mail, the Post Office can easily be found, as the Post Office clock tower is shaped like a praying monk.<br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  During the late afternoon we will continue on toward St. John’s.&nbsp; Our onboard Videographer will present his/her Voyage-DVD, a good opportunity to recall all the different impressions the St. Lawrence Gulf and St. Pierre had to offer. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 10 — St. John’s, Canada</strong> <br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Cloud.</em></p>\n<p><em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Colón, Panama</b>\n</p><p>Embark <i>Silver Cloud </i>and depart on your exciting 11-day Silversea Expedition — Central and South American Wonders. This evening, after settling in and participating in a mandatory safety drill, we will be setting sail and your Expedition Leader will introduce important members of the crew and the Expedition Team. Tonight we invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in one of the many restaurants.\n</p><p>We will relocate to the entrance of the Panama Canal, waiting for the beginning of our transit the following morning.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 2 — Panama Canal, Panama</b>\n</p><p>Today we pass through the narrowest part of the Isthmus of Panama and the American continent. The Panama Canal is an engineering marvel connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. Three sets of locks work as water elevators lifting ships to the level of Gatun Lake and later lowering them again to sea level on the other side. By using the Canal, vessels avoid travelling the 14,000 nautical mile route through the treacherous Drake Passage and around Cape Horn at the southernmost tip of South America.\n</p><p>By the time we intend to use the Canal a new set of locks has been operating since June 2016. All aspects of the improvement (dredging, raising the operating level of Lake Gatun by 40 centimetres, as well as the Pacific Access Channel) were supposed to permit 1,100 additional transits per year.\n</p><p>\nNOTE: Although we have requested and booked a day-time transit, due to heavy traffic in the Canal, a daylight transit cannot be guaranteed. Confirmation of exact times will be established once we get close to our actual transit date.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 3 — Isla Coiba, Panama</b>\n</p><p>Making full use of our small manoeuvrable Zodiacs, we hope to land at this remote part of Panama for a hike through the rainforest. Our onboard naturalists will point out the local flora and search for signs of wildlife. </p><p>\n\nJust offshore from this nature preserve, a rocky headland provides an ideal spot for snorkelling. Join the onboard Marine Biologist and learn to identify damsel fish, jacks, and surgeon fish, trumpet fish, parrot fish, trigger fish and white tip reef sharks. Take this opportunity to relax on the beach and enjoy true Silversea hospitality as your butlers serve fresh fruit skewers and a variety of cocktails. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 4 — Golfito, Costa Rica</b> </p><p>\nToday we have the opportunity to visit Santuario Silvestre de Osa – the only wildlife sanctuary and rescue centre in Golfo Dulce that devotes all of its efforts to the care and rehabilitation of rainforest animals. The sanctuary is home to a wide variety of orphaned and injured animals including: howler monkeys, spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys, white-faced capuchin monkeys, scarlet macaws, toucans, parrots and two-toed sloths. We will enjoy the sanctuary grounds in the company of the park’s creators and wardens as they share their wealth of knowledge on local natural history and show us some of these animals. We will also visit Casa Orquideas, a beautiful garden that contains many tropical plants and a medicinal garden.</p><p>\n\nIf you prefer to watch for dolphins and other marine life, choose to go on a catamaran. The country’s best spot to watch large groups of dolphins, sea turtles and manta rays is in the waters off the Osa Peninsula. Marlins and sailfish can sometimes be seen chasing large schools of tuna, while six different species of turtles might glide by. If time permits there will be the opportunity to swim in the placid waters of Punta Encato.\n</p><p>\nFor those wanting a little more activity, a nature walk in the National Wildlife Refuge of Golfito is on offer. Golfito is surrounded by a spectacular primary rainforest with more than 125 species of trees, 31 species of orchids, and 300 species of birds. Bird species that can be spotted during the hikes include toucans and tanagers, while all four Costa Rican monkey species also call Golfito National Wildlife Refuge home.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 5 — Puerto Quepos, Costa Rica</b>\n</p><p>We go ashore by Zodiac to the small port town of Quepos. Quepos is less than 4.5 miles (7 km) from Costa Rica’s most popular gem, Manuel Antonio National Park, which is where we begin the day’s exploration. Manuel Antonio National Park is one of the most stunning and bio-diverse areas of the world. Spread out over 683 hectares it is filled with diverse wildlife, has both primary and secondary forests, boasts a stunning shoreline ideal for bird watching or swimming, and is home to a number of endemic species of plants and animals including iguanas, sloths, and squirrel monkeys. Together with our informative Costa Rican naturalist guides we will hike through the exotic, bio-diverse tropical rainforests.\n\n</p><p>Alternatively, enjoy a cruise through the mangroves, considered to be an important ecosystem packed with hundreds of species of marine and land animals aboard a sturdy vessel designed for this type of cruising. Your guides and captain navigate around shifting sandbanks to reveal the animals, insects and plants that lie hidden from the untrained eye. We will pass through wide lagoons where many species of seabirds can be observed, and round narrow passages, hoping for a chance to encounter white-collared capuchin monkeys.\n</p><p>If cruising on a river is more to your liking, choose the Savegre River, considered one of Central America’s most beautiful rivers, for a two-hour class I &amp; II amazing river floating activity. During the bus-ride to El Silencio, from where the river part starts, and the river floating you will have spectacular scenery and can see cormorants, egrets, herons, and White Ibises.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 6 — At Sea</b>\n</p><p>Attend informative lectures that will prepare you for the upcoming ports-of-call in Ecuador and Peru.\nApart from lectures there will also be a food workshop. Since bananas and plantains are very important in Ecuador’s cuisine, our Chef might present the various uses for banana and plantain. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 7 — Isla de la Plata, Ecuador</b>\n</p><p>Exploration and discovery await us as we anchor off the coast of the uninhabited and unspoilt Isla de la Plata. An island whose name was derived from the legend of swashbuckling pirate Sir Francis Drake’s buried silver treasure. The island was privately owned until 1979, when it was declared part of Ecuador's Machalilla National Park. Best known for its fauna, which is amazingly similar to that of the Galapagos Islands, Isla de la Plata is a delightful place for birding, photography and long nature walks.\n</p><p>\nAlthough just south of the equator, the influences of the colder Humboldt Current bring nutrient-rich water as far north as Isla de la Plata. As the Silver Cloud approaches the island, Blue-footed Boobies circle overhead. Together with our local natural history guides, we will go ashore and enjoy various walks, watching for herons, pelicans, gulls, and Magnificent Frigatebirds, Blue-footed, Red-footed, and Nazca Boobies. Potential songbirds on the island include Collared Warbling-Finch, Short-tailed Woodstar, and Gray-and-white Tyrannulet. A special treat would be the Waved Albatross, an endemic to Isla de la Plata and Española, Galapagos. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 8 — Machala, Ecuador</b>\n</p><p>Machala, with a population of approximately 250,000 inhabitants, is called the “Capital of the Banana” as the ‘World Fair of the Banana’ is held there during the third week of September. Fortunately for us, there is more to Machala than just bananas: opposite Machala is Santa Clara. Whales and dolphins can still be seen in Santa Clara’s vicinity in October. </p><p>\n\nSeveral National Sanctuaries or Ecological Reserves can be found near Machala and you have three options: you can either visit the Buenaventura cloud forest reserve with its staggering amount of hummingbirds and a known lek of the rare Long-wattled Umbrellabird, or visit the Arenillas Reserve, a “dry forest”. If you like extremes, the Puyango Petrified Forest might be more to your liking: it is one of the largest petrified forests in the world –located within a lush tropical forest.\n</p><p>\nSince Machala is also known for several typical dishes, mostly seafood -from raw marinated shrimp to shrimp soup and fried shrimp; and from fried bananas to fish soup, all excursions will have some sample of local refreshments. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 9 — Paita, Peru</b>\n</p><p>While Silver Cloud sails south towards Peru, take the time to attend one of the lectures, seminars or workshops, savour the tempting food our chefs have prepared for you or simply relax next to the pool –a Pisco Sour might be a good first introduction to Peru and its special tastes.\nIn the evening we will arrive in Paita for a technical stop to clear into Peru.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 10 — Cruise &amp; Explore Isla Lobos de Tierra, Peru</b>\n</p><p>Today, the Silver Cloud anchors off Isla Lobos de Tierra and Lobos de Tierra — steep and rocky islands that protrude more than 200 feet (61 metres) from the surface of the deep blue Pacific. An abundant array of marine mammals and seabirds surround these two islands and offer us a splendid opportunity to explore with our Zodiacs. Sea lions bask on the beach and hundreds of Blue-footed Boobies can be viewed ashore as well, while Peruvian Pelicans pass overhead. If the weather permits, we will attempt to make a landing on the island. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 11 — Salaverry, Peru</b>\n</p><p>This morning we explore the main religious centre of the Mochica culture. The archaeological complex includes the Temple of the Sun –one of the largest adobe structures in the world- and the Temple of the Moon, covered with beautiful Moche designs.\n</p><p>\nWe will next visit a private hacienda for sparkling wine and appetizers, witnessing a performance of Peruvian Paso horses -an unrivalled opportunity to immerse ourselves in genuine Peruvian culture spanning centuries. </p><p>\n\nDuring the afternoon our onboard Videographer will present the specially created voyage documentary.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 12 — Callao (Lima), Peru</b>\n</p><p>After breakfast, disembark <i>Silver Cloud.\n</i></p><p><i>\nExpedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather and wildlife activity.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Callao, Peru</b>\n</p><p>Embark the <i>Silver Cloud</i> and depart on your exciting culinary Silversea Expedition — “Sights, Sounds and Tastes of South America”. \nDuring a special sail away party you will be introduced to our guest Chef, who will lead your culinary team up to Arica, and learn about the aspects of the first part of our unique epicurean voyage of discovery. </p><p>  \n\nLater you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and this evening you can enjoy the delights of a specially prepared menu in one of the dining venues.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 2 — Paracas and Ballestas Islands, Peru\n</b></p><p><b>Optional Nazca Lines Overflight</b>\n</p><p>\nDuring our stay in Paracas you will have the opportunity to see the famous Nazca Lines from the air in an optional excursion. The Nazca Desert will reveal a series of famous geoglyphs stretching for miles along the Pacific coast. Dating back to an era between 200BC and 700AD, these mysterious figures and geometric patterns are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The lines show an understanding of sophisticated mathematics and surveying techniques.\n</p><p>Please be aware that seats on this flight are limited and enquire with Reservations beforehand. </p><p>\nOne of the choices in Paracas is to explore the Ballestas Islands on a local boat. The islands are one of this region’s most beautiful natural attractions. Sea lions, cormorants, Blue-footed Boobies, terns, pelicans and Humboldt Penguins can all be expected around the Ballestas Islands. Because of Peruvian regulations this excursion can only be done in local boats and landings are not allowed. </p><p>\n\nIf you are interested in history, take a guided excursion to see Tambo Colorado, once a regional centre of the Incan empire. The complex includes three palaces, residential buildings and a central plaza. Built primarily out of adobe, the structures have been remarkably preserved, including the wall paintings\n</p><p>\nIf you are interested in how Pisco is produced, visit the Hacienda La Caravedo which has the oldest functioning distillery. Tour the distillery and taste the many varieties of Pisco the hacienda produces. At the hacienda you will also be able to team up with local expert ceramists to create your own piece of pottery.\n\n</p><p>This evening, your Peruvian culinary expert will present his selection of tempting Peruvian specialties on our voyage of culinary discovery.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 3 — At Sea</b>\n</p><p>Gather in the Lecture Theatre to get an introduction to Chile and to learn about the region’s wildlife and remarkable nature. </p><p>\nDue to the presence of the very nutrient-rich Humboldt Current, the waters along the Peruvian coast are incredibly rich in fish life. Today our chefs will introduce you to the world of “ceviche” in all its forms.\n</p><p>\nThis evening we will have a special Peruvian-themed dinner.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 4 — Arica, Chile</b>\n</p><p>Today you have multiple choices for half day or full day excursions:\n</p><p>An early morning departure is necessary for a journey to explore the region’s unique Altiplano scenery. We will see important archaeological sites along the way before the landscape suddenly opens up and the wide valley of Putre can be seen beneath massive, snow-capped peaks. Upon our arrival in Putre, we will enjoy lunch in a local restaurant. Later we will stroll through town together, visiting the church and watching a performance of Andean folklore in the main plaza. </p><p>\nAlternatively, enjoy a visit to the Lauca National Park. This is a challenging excursion, taking you to an altitude of 4,500 metres. From the pier we drive to Copaquilla, where a pre-Incan defensive settlement known as a Pukara can be seen. Driving past Putre, we will reach Chungará Lake to admire the mountains reflected in the lake. During one hour at the lake we will look for the many local bird species, among them the Chilean Flamingo. During the stay at the lake a box lunch will be served. On the return we will stop at the abandoned pre-Hispanic village of Parinacota, a National Monument.\n</p><p>\nThe half day excursions will permit you to either visit the Archaeological Museum and to see the main highlights of the downtown area and having a view from the iconic promontory El Morro or to visit the local market, choosing fresh produce with the help of a local chef, visit a farm and learn about the famous Azapa olives and taste the special appetizers prepared by the local chef with the products you selected at the market.\n</p><p>Other half day tours will feature local foods selected by you at the market and prepared by local chefs while visiting some emblematic natural highlights in the vicinity of Arica.\n</p><p>\nAfter these excursions take your time to join the bar team for a Pisco evening. Learn more about this iconic drink and whether this is an original Peruvian or Chilean drink.</p><p>\n<b>Day 5 — At Sea</b>\n</p><p>Silversea’s Head Sommelier who will be joined by a Chilean sommelier will introduce you to the delights of Chilean wine. </p><p>\n\t\nAttend a wine seminar and relax next to the pool or in one of the lounges with that book you’ve been meaning to read and meet up with new friends for cocktails. Before turning in for the night, take a stroll on deck to take in the solitude of the vast sea and sky.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 6 — Antofagasta, Chil</b>e\n</p><p>Visit the Atacama Desert — one of the driest places on earth. Depart early for the seven-hour ride to the charming adobe village of San Pedro de Atacama.  We will visit the small village, having a look at the delightful adobe church (declared a National Monument), and walk the narrow, picturesque streets. At a local restaurant we will have a welcome cocktail, while local artisans present their handicrafts, and a delicious lunch will follow. Finally we will be heading to Valle de la Luna. In this unique lunar landscape we will see numerous rock formations jutting out of the sand, eroded by wind into incredible shapes. At a lookout, we will enjoy a special cocktail party while observing an indigenous ritual to Mother Earth. \n</p><p>Alternatively, a half-day city tour is available. Antofagasta is a refined blend of traditional Chilean town and British colonial city. We will see the Huanchaca Ruins and during a walking tour will visit the Plaza Colón and the Regional Museum with its overview of the saltpetre industry and how it affected the region. We will then walk to the fishing wharf where a local chef will prepare some of the freshly caught seafood for you to taste. The final destination will be Antofagasta’s landmark La Portada, an enormous rock caressed by the sea and sand until a giant arch formed. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 7 — Isla Pan de Azucar, Chile</b>\n</p><p>This morning our culinary team will focus on shellfish and other seafood and the various ways to prepare these in a workshop. From raw to steamed –find your preferred dish accompanied with the perfect Chilean wine.\n</p><p>\nThis afternoon we explore the rugged shores of Isla Pan de Azucar (or Sugarloaf Island) by Zodiac. The island is home to thousands of Humboldt Penguins. During our Zodiac cruise along the perimeter of Isla Pan de Azucar, we also hope to encounter Kelp Gulls, Turkey Vultures, Blackish Oystercatchers, and Peruvian Boobies, pelicans, sea lions and the reclusive South American marine otter.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 8 — Coquimbo, Chile</b>\n</p><p>Today you have several choices: a half day visit to the Elqui Valley, a visit to the Tabalí Vineyard, the nearby town of La Serena or a longer visit to the Limarí Valley.\n</p><p>For the excursion into the Elqui Valley we follow the coast going north. The Elqui Valley is an important agricultural area for papayas, olives, pears and custard apples. This is also where muscatel grapes are turned into Pisco, Chile’s national spirit.\n</p><p>We will visit the small and picturesque artist village of Diaguitas and explore its arid and attractive streets. At a local workshop you will have the opportunity to buy handmade crafts featuring the stunning and beautiful Diaguita designs and iconography. Afterwards we will drive to Vicuña. Famous for its many Pisco producers it was also home to Chilean’s Nobel Prize winner in literature, Gabriela Mistral. We will visit the Plaza and the Bauer Tower and will have time to explore independently before returning back to Coquimbo and <i>Silver Cloud</i>.\n</p><p>Another half day visit will be made to the seaside resort of La Serena with its open air museum of statues and the historical centre where three different architectural periods can be seen.\n</p><p>The full day excursion will take us into the Limarí Valley, slightly further south. Known for its pictographs and petroglyphs of the El Molle culture, we will visit the Enchanted Valley in the vicinity of the town of Ovalle. The Elqui and Limarí Valleys are rich and fertile transversal valleys running across the coastal mountains, leading to their importance as agricultural areas. Grapes are grown in impressive vineyards for export and for wine and we will visit the Tabalí winery. This vineyard is well known for its unique coupages and blends of wine stocks such as Viognier, Sangiovese and Carmenere. A guided tour of the winery will be given, followed by a tasting of its most representative wines.\n</p><p>We will then continue to a local restaurant for a typical Chilean lunch of empanadas and an asado (a BBQ), before returning to the pier. </p><p>\nThis excursion can also be done as a half day tour without the typical Chilean lunch.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 9 — At Sea</b>\n</p><p>A leisurely day at sea is yours to enjoy. Participate in discussions and onboard activities led by the Expedition Team and join our chefs for a ceviche workshop, preparing your own ceviche for lunch –our chefs will assist you in creating your </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 10 — Niebla, Chile</b>\n</p><p>During the morning <i>Silver Cloud</i> will head further south, giving our lecturers time to introduce you to the natural and historical highlights of Valdivia and Chile’s Lake District. \nNiebla is a small village on the banks of the Rio Valdivia where Chile’s Corral Bay meets the Pacific Ocean. Today Niebla is a beach resort, but in 1671 it was a defensive fortress built by Spanish conquerors to prevent attacks from pirates and corsairs. </p><p>\n\nThis afternoon you can either drive to the charming river port city of Valdivia, where we will find an interesting blend of influences from the native Mapuche, Spanish settlers, and German immigrants, or take a catamaran on the river. In both cases you will have time to see the town of Valdivia. The first German colonists arrived here in 1849 and worked hard to develop Valdivia into one of southern Chile’s most productive areas and their influence can be felt in every corner of this city. The town was affected by the 1960 earthquake –the worst ever recorded and the strongest in the last 110 years- but rebuilt with a strong German imprint. On our way to Valdivia we can see tracts of land that are still under water as a result of the quake. We will visit the river market and have a look at downtown Valdivia with its mix of old and modern buildings. You will have to choose whether you would like to visit the Fort at Niebla or enjoy fresh fish and crabs in Valdivia. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 11 — Puerto Montt, Chile</b>\n</p><p>Puerto Montt is the starting point for our excursions to the Lake District and specifically Lago Llanquihue.\n\n</p><p>We will drive along the southern shore of Chile’s second- largest lake and head for the Petrohué waterfalls. These falls ‘connect’ Lago Esmeralda with Lago Llanquihue and we will walk over to the viewing platforms of Chile’s best-known falls. Here we will have an opportunity to see some of the local plants and endemic trees. Later you will have the choice to either visit a typical Chilean farm to learn about the traditions of southern Chile’s food music, tools and the national sport of rodeo –which is quite different from the North American version- or to have lunch at a local restaurant and to explore the town of Puerto Varas.\n\nIf you choose the Fundo Olguita, you will have lunch including empanadas, a tasty barbeque und traditional German desserts –this area was first colonized by Germans in the mid-19th century. You will also have the chance to learn the Chilean national dance, the Cueca.\n</p><p>If you choose Puerto Varas, you will have time to explore the “City of Roses” –as Puerto Varas is known- and to browse the small handicraft village and see some of the wooden buildings for which the town was declared a “Heritage Zone”.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 12 —Puerto Chacabuco, Chile</b>\n</p><p>During the morning, Silver Cloud will pass the Las Huichas Islands to enter the Aisén Fjord. Halfway up the fjord, we pass the National Monument Cinco Hermanas (Five Sisters), which despite the name consists of six islands. Marine otters and South American sea lions can often be seen nearby. At the end of fjord Puerto Chacabuco is the main port for the Aisén Region. Upon arrival we will drive to the private park Aiken del Sur. At the park we will be divided into small groups. You can choose to walk a difficult 2km trail, ascending to 2,030m through swamp and severe gradients on a narrow trail. Or decide on an easier 4km walk through the temperate rain forest. Local guides will escort us, explaining the trees, plants, flowers, mosses and ferns surrounding us. Plants of note are the arrayan (one of the most common trees here, living up to 400 years), quila bamboo, Chilean fire bush, and Chilean rhubarb as well as Calafate flowers. Birders will be interested to hear and see along the trail the Chucao Tapaculo, with its beautiful red breast, or the Black-throated Huet-huet. Soaring Andean Condors are often seen, too.\n</p><p>The groups will also visit a Quincho, where they will be rewarded with a choice of drinks (Pisco sour being first and foremost, as always in Chile) and delicious snacks, both savory and sweet. A local music group will entertain with typical songs and dancing.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 13 —Tortel, Chile</b>\n</p><p><i>Silver Cloud</i> will sail through the Golfo de Penas –an area well-known for whales and rough seas- to reach Caleta Tortel, one of the southernmost and until 2003 least connected settlements in Chile’s Aisén Region (in Patagonia). The abundant cypress led to the founding of the village and most houses are built on stilts along the shoreline of this hilly terrain. There are no conventional streets; instead the houses are connected by wooden walkways. We will explore the village –where a folkloric presentation awaits us at the main plaza- and will take our Zodiacs cruise through the channels and the Baker River to visit “La Isla de los Muertos”, a small island used as a cemetery in 1906. Both the village and the island have been declared National Monuments.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 14 —Cruise English Narrows and Pio XI Glacier, Chile</b>\n</p><p>Early this morning, be out on deck to watch as we head towards the English Narrows. Our Captain and the local Chilean Pilots expertly manoeuvre Silver Cloud through the slalom course of islands and channel markers. At the narrowest part it has a width of 80 metres, permitting the passage of only one vessel at a time. During this cruise, we may spot Magellanic Diving Petrels and Steamer Ducks, and if we are very lucky, we may spot the endemic Chilean dolphin. Shy of ships, this small dolphin enjoys spending its time in narrow channels with heavy tidal rips.\n\n</p><p>We should pass the English Narrows before breakfast time –although you can see the Narrows from the comfort of your suite, you really should be out on deck. </p><p>\n\nOnce we have passed the English Narrows you will have time for a leisurely breakfast and to attend lectures about the Fjords’ natural history or perhaps a seminar. The whole region of the fjords is so inhospitable that only one single settlement exists south of the English Narrows –Puerto Eden.\nBirders will want to see what species want to live in this area. The further south we head the better the chance to see Andean Condors majestically soaring above the hills and mountains.</p><p> \n\nIn the afternoon we will visit the Pio XI Glacier. This tidewater glacier sprawled out in front of us is 4.5 km wide and a remarkable shade of brilliant blue. An outlet glacier of the South Patagonian Ice Field, the Pio XI had once extended out into the fjords whose waters we ply today. Conditions permitting, we will board our Zodiacs and dodge brash ice and bergy bits as we approach the glacier at a safe distance. Alert for signs of calving, we may see chunks of ice falling from the glacier front. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 15 —Cruise the Chilean Fjords</b>\n</p><p>Our course will take us through the vast expense of the Chilean Fjords. We will sail through Chile’s largest national park, Bernardo O’Higgins, before we head for another famous narrow channel, the western portion of the Strait of Magellan. Mountains loom on both sides of Silver Explorer and one can only marvel at the hardy flora trying to cling to the barren rocks. Occasionally seals and dolphins can be seen.\n\nSilver Cloud will head for the Strait of Magellan and the Francisco Coloane Marine Park, an area humpback whales are known to frequent.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 16 —Alberto de Agostini National Park and Ainsworth Bay, Tierra del Fuego, Chile</b>\n</p><p>Today we will navigate past Dawson Island –quite infamous in Chile’s modern-day history as a penal settlement for political prisoners- into Almirantazgo Sound, to arrive at Ainsworth Bay. The bay is within Alberto De Agostini National Park, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Depending on conditions, we intend to offer a Zodiac cruise to see the Marinelli Glacier descending from Darwin Mountain Range. This area will give a good appreciation how the land returns to life after glacial retreat. We also intend to take a walk in the stunning sub-polar Magellanic forest teeming with evergreens and deciduous trees. The bay promises a good chance of sighting Southern elephant seals, while nearby Tucker Island is known to have Magellanic Penguins.\n</p><p>\nDuring the night <i>Silver Cloud</i> will again head into the Strait of Magellan, sailing for Punta Arenas. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 17 —Punta Arenas, Chile</b>\n</p><p>After breakfast disembark <i>Silver Cloud.\n</i></p><p><i>\n\nExpedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Punta Arenas, Chile</b>\n</p><p>Embark <i>Silver Cloud</i>, settle in and attend a mandatory safety drill before leaving port. During the afternoon you will be introduced to some of the important crew members and your Expedition Team. At sail away bid farewell to the Magallanes Region and take the famous Strait of Magellan heading for the South Atlantic.\n</p><p>\t\n<b>Day 2 — At Sea</b>\n</p><p>As we set sail on our initial transit, familiarise yourself with the elegant Silver Cloud and the Expedition Team members. Attend wildlife, geography and history discussions hosted by our expert naturalists and guest lecturers preparing you for the exciting adventures that lie ahead.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 3 — New Island and West Point Island, Falkland Islands/Malvinas</b>\n</p><p>During the morning we will visit New Island, a wildlife and nature reserve. Our Zodiacs will take us ashore near the island’s small settlement at Coffin Harbour. From there we will hike across the island to reach the rocky cliffs and a rookery where Rockhopper Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags share the same nesting area. We will also observe Black-browed Albatross going about their daily routines and may even spot Upland Geese on our hike.\t\nDuring lunch, Silver Cloud will sail in a north-easterly direction to West Point Island. Peale’s dolphins and Commerson’s dolphins with their distinctive markings can often be spotted as Silver Cloud approaches the island. \nWalking across rolling moorland and past gorse for slightly less than 2 miles, we will be observed by Grass Wrens, Long-tailed Meadowlarks, Falkland Thrushes, Striated Caracaras and Turkey Vultures, but our goal is to reach Devil’s Nose and colonies of Black-browed Albatross that nest side-by-side with Rockhopper Penguins. The winds at Devil’s Nose are usually so strong that the albatross only have to spread their wings to take off.\n</p><p>\nOnce back at the farm, the hospitable island owners will invite you to have tea, coffee and home-made cakes and cookies and are always happy to answer your questions and share their stories.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 4 — Stanley, Falkland Islands/Malvinas</b>\n</p><p>Stanley is the capital of the remote Falkland Islands, and –although Argentine authorities have repeatedly claimed the islands as part of their country- has a distinct British ambience. A reminder of the 1982 Falkland War between Britain and Argentina is the War Memorial.\n</p><p>\t\nOpt to take a ‘city tour’ by bus with a local guide or stroll through the charming streets of this colourful little town, lined with quaint cottages and a variety of traditional pubs. Visit the 19th-century Anglican cathedral (the southernmost Anglican cathedral in the world) and wander through the Falkland Islands Dockyard Museum. For stamp collectors a visit to the Philatelic Bureau is a must.\n</p><p>\t\n<b>Day 5 — Drake Passage</b>\n</p><p>The Drake Passage has a notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to the westerly winds and the funnelling effect of the passage. With modern navigational aids and stabilizers <i>Silver Cloud </i>will bring you safely across these southern waters.\n</p><p>\nSpend some time on deck watching the horizon and the variety of seabirds that glide in the air currents of our ship’s wake -such as the Wandering Albatross, Cape Petrels, White-chinned Petrels and Sooty Shearwaters. </p><p>\n\n<b>Days 6–9 — Antarctic Peninsula</b>\n</p><p>While sailing in Antarctica’s vast white wilderness, a flexible itinerary will allow us to take advantage of favourable sea and weather conditions. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter. </p><p>\n\nHere are some of the places we may visit:\n</p><p>\n<b>-Brown Bluff, Tabarin Peninsula (a 2,200-foot bluff on the Antarctic continent)</b>\n</p><p>Brown Bluff is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock.\nAdelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels use the base of Brown Bluff as a breeding area. Birds such as the all-white Snow Petrel and skuas may be seen from a distance. Weddell seals may be seen basking in the sunlight near the base of a glacier.\n</p><p>\n<b>-Paulet Island</b>\n</p><p>The sight of Adelie Penguins covering the entire island is quite amazing. The island is home to 80-90 thousand Adelies that come here to breed. On a nearby hill is a massive colony of Blue-eyed Shags. Kelp Gulls and Snowy Sheathbills are amongst the birds that also breed on Paulet Island, and Wilson’s Storm-petrels are regularly seen.\nMembers of a Swedish Antarctic expedition had to over-winter on the island in 1912 after their ship was ship-wrecked. Remnants of their hut still remain and you will have to walk past the hut on your way to the islands lake.\n</p><p>\n<b>-Cuverville Island, Errera Channe</b>l\n</p><p>The island was discovered by Gerlache’s Belgian Antarctic expedition of 1897–99, and was named for a vice admiral in the French navy.\nLarge, bare rock areas provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins. Snow Petrels and Cape Petrels also may be seen, whilst Wilson’s Storm-petrels nest in the higher scree of the island.\nDuring Zodiac tours, hauled-out Weddell and Antarctic fur seals are quite often encountered.\n\n</p><p><b>-Paradise Bay (on the Antarctic Peninsula)</b>\n</p><p>The bay is well named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs. The <i>Silver Cloud </i>will reach Argentina’s “Base Almirante Brown”, one of many Antarctic research stations. Here, you will actually set foot on the mainland of Antarctica.\n</p><p>You can also view the wildlife from sea level while cruising in our Zodiacs. Apart from observing nesting shags in the cliffs there is a good chance to see crabeater seals relaxing on ice floes, and you might even locate Minke whales.\n</p><p>\n<b>-Neko Harbour (on the Antarctic Peninsula)</b>\n</p><p>Neko Harbour offers a visit to small penguin rookeries, a nice Zodiac cruise in search of whales and the possibility to hike onto a glacier for spectacular views of the glaciers, the bay and the ship. The common breeding birds are Gentoo Penguins, but Chinstrap Penguins, Kelp Gulls and skuas can be seen too. Seals are often hauled-out close to the landing site.\n</p><p>\n<b>-Port Lockroy, Goudier Island</b>\n</p><p>The British built a listening station here during WWII, which was later used as a research station in the 1950s and since 1996 as a museum and gift shop and Post Office. While you are inside sending a postcard from this lonely outpost, Snowy Sheathbills and Gentoo Penguins roam outside the museum.\n\n</p><p><b>-Port Foster, Whalers Bay (Deception Island)</b>\n</p><p>Deception Island is an excellent example of a caldera that can be reached from the sea. We plan to sail inside the caldera through a narrow entrance called Neptune’s Bellows.\nOur Geologist might take the opportunity to explain the unique volcanic features of the area, while our Historian will introduce you to Deception Island’s interesting history -from whaling to scientific studies. Still visible on the island are the boilers used to make whale oil in the early 1900s.\n</p><p>\n<b>Days 10–11 — Drake Passage Return</b></p><p>\nNavigating our return through the Drake Passage, we will watch for seabirds and wildlife we may have missed on the first leg down. Take this opportunity to attend additional presentations offered by the Expedition Team lecturers and to edit the many photos taken as we travel towards Ushuaia.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 12 — Ushuaia, Argentina</b>\n</p><p>After breakfast, disembark <i>Silver Cloud.\n</i></p><p><i>\n\nExpedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><b>Day 1 — Ushuaia, Argentina</b>\n</p><p>Embark <i>Silver Cloud</i>, settle in and attend a mandatory safety drill before leaving port. During the afternoon you will be introduced to some of the important crew members and your Expedition Team. At sail away bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego and take the famous Beagle Channel heading for the South Atlantic.\n</p><p>\t\n<b>Day 2 — At Sea</b>\n</p><p>As we set sail on our initial transit, familiarise yourself with the elegant Silver Cloud and the Expedition Team members. Attend wildlife, geography and history discussions hosted by our expert naturalists and guest lecturers preparing you for the exciting adventures that lie ahead.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 3 — New Island and West Point Island, Falkland Islands/Malvinas</b>\n</p><p>During the morning we will visit New Island, a wildlife and nature reserve. Our Zodiacs will take us ashore near the island’s small settlement at Coffin Harbour. From there we will hike across the island to reach the rocky cliffs and a rookery where Rockhopper Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags share the same nesting area. We will also observe Black-browed Albatross going about their daily routines and may even spot Upland Geese on our hike.\t\nDuring lunch, Silver Cloud will sail in a north-easterly direction to West Point Island. Peale’s dolphins and Commerson’s dolphins with their distinctive markings can often be spotted as Silver Cloud approaches the island. \nWalking across rolling moorland and past gorse for slightly less than 2 miles, we will be observed by Grass Wrens, Long-tailed Meadowlarks, Falkland Thrushes, Striated Caracaras and Turkey Vultures, but our goal is to reach Devil’s Nose and colonies of Black-browed Albatross that nest side-by-side with Rockhopper Penguins. The winds at Devil’s Nose are usually so strong that the albatross only have to spread their wings to take off.\nOnce back at the farm, the hospitable island owners will invite you to have tea, coffee and home-made cakes and cookies and are always happy to answer your questions and share their stories.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 4 — Stanley, Falkland Islands/Malvinas</b>\n</p><p>Stanley is the capital of the remote Falkland Islands, and –although Argentine authorities have repeatedly claimed the islands as part of their country- has a distinct British ambience. A reminder of the 1982 Falkland War between Britain and Argentina is the War Memorial.\n</p><p>\t\nOpt to take a ‘city tour’ by bus with a local guide or stroll through the charming streets of this colourful little town, lined with quaint cottages and a variety of traditional pubs. Visit the 19th-century Anglican cathedral (the southernmost Anglican cathedral in the world) and wander through the Falkland Islands Dockyard Museum. For stamp collectors a visit to the Philatelic Bureau is a must.\n</p><p>\n<b>Day 5 — Bleaker Island and Sea Lion Island, Falkland Islands/Malvinas</b>\n</p><p>Bleaker Island is privately owned, with sheep and Hereford cattle grazing on its extensive greens, yet it is also an excellent site for birding. The Bleaker Island Group is recognized as an Important Bird Area and its northern part is a National Nature Reserve. Landing at Sandy Bay, not too far from Ghost Island, you will see Magellanic and Gentoo Penguins. Several colonies of Southern Rockhopper Penguins breed at Long Gulch, and on the walk watch out for Crested and Striated Caracaras, Ruddy-headed Geese, Silvery and White-tufted Grebes, as well as Speckled and Silver Teal. While Rock Cormorants prefer Long Gulch, the Imperial Cormorant has its main colony in the centre of the island.\n</p><p>\nDuring lunch <i>Silver Cloud</i> will sail to Sea Lion Island. As the name suggests Sea Lion island was and is home to southern sea lions, but it also holds some 95% of the Falklands southern elephant seal population. Although the breeding season ends in November, yearlings and non-breeders come ashore in late November and can be seen until April. Because of the penguins and the seal populations and the deeply shelving coastline, this island is one of the best places in the Falkland Islands to see orcas (killer whales) –there are two resident pods. While riding a Zodiac ashore or back to the Silver Cloud, Commerson’s dolphins are likely to be seen. While ashore, Cobb’s Wren and Tussacbirds are easily found. </p><p>\n\n<b>Day 6 — Drake Passage</b>\n</p><p>The Drake Passage has a notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to the westerly winds and the funnelling effect of the passage. With modern navigational aids and stabilizers Silver Cloud will bring you safely across these southern waters.\n</p><p>\nSpend some time on deck watching the horizon and the variety of seabirds that glide in the air currents of our ship’s wake -such as the Wandering Albatross, Cape Petrels, White-chinned Petrels and Sooty Shearwaters. </p><p>\n\n<b>Days 7–13 — Antarctic Peninsula</b>\n</p><p>While sailing in Antarctica’s vast white wilderness, a flexible itinerary will allow us to take advantage of favourable sea and weather conditions. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter. \nHere are some of the places we may visit:\n</p><p>\n<b>-Brown Bluff, Tabarin Peninsula (a 2,200-foot bluff on the Antarctic continent)</b>\n</p><p>Brown Bluff is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock.\nAdelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels use the base of Brown Bluff as a breeding area. Birds such as the all-white Snow Petrel and skuas may be seen from a distance. Weddell seals may be seen basking in the sunlight near the base of a glacier.\n</p><p>\n<b>-Paulet Island</b>\n</p><p>The sight of Adelie Penguins covering the entire island is quite amazing. The island is home to 80-90 thousand Adelies that come here to breed. On a nearby hill is a massive colony of Blue-eyed Shags. Kelp Gulls and Snowy Sheathbills are amongst the birds that also breed on Paulet Island, and Wilson’s Storm-petrels are regularly seen.\n</p><p>\nMembers of a Swedish Antarctic expedition had to over-winter on the island in 1912 after their ship was ship-wrecked. Remnants of their hut still remain and you will have to walk past the hut on your way to the islands lake.\n</p><p>\n<b>-Cuverville Island, Errera Channel</b></p><p>\nThe island was discovered by Gerlache’s Belgian Antarctic expedition of 1897–99, and was named for a vice admiral in the French navy.\n</p><p>\nLarge, bare rock areas provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins. Snow Petrels and Cape Petrels also may be seen, whilst Wilson’s Storm-petrels nest in the higher scree of the island.\nDuring Zodiac tours, hauled-out Weddell and Antarctic fur seals are quite often encountered.\n</p><p>\n<b>-Paradise Bay (on the Antarctic Peninsula)</b>\n</p><p>The bay is well named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs. The Silver Cloud will reach Argentina’s “Base Almirante Brown”, one of many Antarctic research stations. Here, you will actually set foot on the mainland of Antarctica.\n</p><p>\nYou can also view the wildlife from sea level while cruising in our Zodiacs. Apart from observing nesting shags in the cliffs there is a good chance to see crabeater seals relaxing on ice floes, and you might even locate Minke whales.\n\n-</p><p><b>-Neko Harbour (on the Antarctic Peninsula)</b>\n</p><p>Neko Harbour offers a visit to small penguin rookeries, a nice Zodiac cruise in search of whales and the possibility to hike onto a glacier for spectacular views of the glaciers, the bay and the ship. The common breeding birds are Gentoo Penguins, but Chinstrap Penguins, Kelp Gulls and skuas can be seen too. Seals are often hauled-out close to the landing site.\n</p><p>\n<b>-Lemaire Channel (Between Booth Island and the Peninsula)</b>\n</p><p>The Lemaire Channel (named by Adrien de Gerlache after a Belgian explorer who never came to Antarctica) was first crossed in 1898. The spectacular scenery of the steep snow-covered mountains and the tranquil waters in conjunction with the probability to see whales and seals will make this one of the most memorable places during the voyage. </p><p>\n\n<b>-Port Lockroy, Goudier Island</b>\n</p><p>The British built a listening station here during WWII, which was later used as a research station in the 1950s and since 1996 as a museum and gift shop and Post Office. While you are inside sending a postcard from this lonely outpost, Snowy Sheathbills and Gentoo Penguins roam outside the museum.</p><p>\n\n<b>-Port Foster, Whalers Bay (Deception Island)</b>\n</p><p>Deception Island is an excellent example of a caldera that can be reached from the sea.

During the afternoon you will be introduced to some of the important crew members and your Expedition Team. At sail away bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego, the ‘Land at the End of the World’.<br />\n&nbsp; <b><br />\n  Days 2–3 — Drake Passage</b><br />\n  As we set sail on our initial transit, familiarise yourself with the elegant <i>Silver Cloud </i>and the Expedition Team members. Partake in wildlife, geography and history discussions hosted by our expert Team Members and naturalists and attend talks by our guest lecturers preparing you for the exciting adventures that lie ahead.</p>\n<p>The Drake Passage has a notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to the westerly winds and the funnelling effect of the passage, but with modern navigational aids and stabilizers <i>Silver Cloud </i>will bring you safely across these southern waters.</p>\n<p>Spend some time on deck watching the horizon and the variety of seabirds that glide in the air currents of our ship’s wake -such as the Black-browed Albatross, Cape Petrels, White-chinned Petrels and Sooty Shearwaters. </p>\n<p><b>Day 4 — Antarctic Sound</b><br />\n  We will start our Antarctic experiences at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula, venturing into Antarctic Sound and its magnificent array of tabular icebergs, historical sites and Adelie and Gentoo Penguin rookeries.<br />\n  Depending on weather and ice conditions <i>Silver Cloud </i>might visit Brown Bluff, Hope Bay and cruise the Antarctic Sound.</p>\n<p>Brown Bluff, (a 2,200-foot bluff on the Antarctic continent) is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock.<br />\n  The coastal area at the base of Brown Bluff is used by Adelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels as a breeding area. Under good climatic conditions a walk onto a nearby glacier might be feasible.</p>\n<p>Hope Bay has one of the largest Adelie Penguin colonies in Antarctica and a Zodiac cruise past the Argentine Station “Esperanza” will show some of the penguins, Weddell seals and Blue-eyed Shags.</p>\n<p><b>Days 5–7 — Antarctic Peninsula</b><br />\n  While sailing in Antarctica’s vast white wilderness, our itinerary will be flexible and in the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter. <br />\n  Here are some of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p>Cuverville Island was discovered by Gerlache’s Belgian Antarctic expedition of 1897–99. Large, bare rock areas provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins. Snow Petrels and Cape Petrels may also be seen, whilst Wilson’s Storm-petrels nest in the higher scree of the island. During Zodiac cruises, hauled-out Weddell seals are quite often encountered. Under good conditions one can climb part of Cuverville’s hill for spectacular panoramic views.</p>\n<p>Paradise Bay is well named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs. The <i>Silver Cloud </i>will sail past Argentina’s “Base Brown”, one of many Antarctic research stations. You can also view the wildlife from sea level while cruising in our Zodiacs. Apart from observing cormorants in the cliffs there is a good chance to see crabeater seals relaxing on ice floes; whales have been seen regularly.</p>\n<p>Petermann Island is named for geographer August Petermann and was discovered by a German expedition in 1873-74.<br />\n  During our landing, we will be able to observe rookeries of Adelie Penguins, Gentoo Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags. Petermann has various geological features, especially rock surfaces showing glacial polish and some glacial grooving.</p>\n<p>Pleneau Bay lies at the south end of the Lemaire Channel, and was first explored during Charcot’s 1903–05 French Antarctic Expedition. Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls and South Polar Skuas are usually found breeding on Pleneau Island and Southern elephant seals are often hauled-out in wallows.<br />\n  Enjoy the spectacular scenery of icebergs nearby either from shore or during a Zodiac cruise.</p>\n<p><b>Day 9 — South Shetland Islands</b><br />\n  We will end our Antarctic sojourn in the South Shetland Islands. </p>\n<p>Port Foster, Whalers Bay and Telefon Bay are all located in Deception Island, an excellent example of a caldera that can be reached from the sea. We plan to sail into the caldera through the narrow entrance called Neptune’s Bellows. Ashore Deception Island’s interesting history -from whaling to scientific studies- still shows remains of a former whaling station, including the boilers used to make whale oil in the early 1900s, and houses belonging to a British research base. The unique volcanic features of the area can be seen during hikes.</p>\n<p>The Aitcho Islands have Gentoo and Chinstrap Penguin colonies. Southern Giant Petrels and skuas are never far from penguin rookeries and elephant seals quite often look for company near the landing site.</p>\n<p><b>Days 9–10 — Drake Passage</b><br />\n  Navigating our return through the Drake Passage, we will watch for seabirds and wildlife we may have missed on our initial crossing. There will be opportunities to attend additional presentations offered by the Expedition Team lecturers and to edit the many photos taken as we travel towards Ushuaia.<br />\n  During the last afternoon, our Photographer/Videographer will show the Voyage –DVD.</p>\n<p><b>Day 11 — Ushuaia, Argentina</b><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <i>Silver Cloud.</i><br />\n</p>\n<p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

Partake in wildlife, geography and history discussions hosted by our expert Team Members and naturalists and attend talks by our guest lecturers preparing you for the exciting adventures that lie ahead.</p>\n<p>The Drake Passage has a notorious reputation for its turbulent seas due to the westerly winds and the funnelling effect of the passage, but with modern navigational aids and stabilizers <i>Silver Cloud </i>will bring you safely across these southern waters.</p>\n<p>Spend some time on deck watching the horizon and the variety of seabirds that glide in the air currents of our ship’s wake -such as the Black-browed Albatross, Cape Petrels, White-chinned Petrels and Sooty Shearwaters. </p>\n<p><b>Day 4 — Antarctic Sound</b><br />\n  We will start our Antarctic experiences at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula, venturing into Antarctic Sound and its magnificent array of tabular icebergs, historical sites and Adelie and Gentoo Penguin rookeries.<br />\n  Depending on weather and ice conditions <i>Silver Cloud </i>might visit Brown Bluff, Hope Bay and cruise the Antarctic Sound.</p>\n<p>Brown Bluff, (a 2,200-foot bluff on the Antarctic continent) is an ice-capped, 745-metre-high, flat-topped mountain with a prominent cliff of reddish-brown volcanic rock.<br />\n  The coastal area at the base of Brown Bluff is used by Adelie and Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls, and Cape Petrels as a breeding area. Under good climatic conditions a walk onto a nearby glacier might be feasible.</p>\n<p>Hope Bay has one of the largest Adelie Penguin colonies in Antarctica and a Zodiac cruise past the Argentine Station “Esperanza” will show some of the penguins, Weddell seals and Blue-eyed Shags.</p>\n<p><b>Days 5–7 — Antarctic Peninsula</b><br />\n  While sailing in Antarctica’s vast white wilderness, our itinerary will be flexible and in the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on weather, ice conditions and wildlife we may encounter. <br />\n  Here are some of the places we may visit:</p>\n<p>Cuverville Island was discovered by Gerlache’s Belgian Antarctic expedition of 1897–99. Large, bare rock areas provide nesting sites for Gentoo Penguins. Snow Petrels and Cape Petrels may also be seen, whilst Wilson’s Storm-petrels nest in the higher scree of the island. During Zodiac cruises, hauled-out Weddell seals are quite often encountered. Under good conditions one can climb part of Cuverville’s hill for spectacular panoramic views.</p>\n<p>Paradise Bay is well named for its spectacular scenery of mountains, glaciers and icebergs. The <i>Silver Cloud </i>will sail past Argentina’s “Base Brown”, one of many Antarctic research stations. You can also view the wildlife from sea level while cruising in our Zodiacs. Apart from observing cormorants in the cliffs there is a good chance to see crabeater seals relaxing on ice floes; whales have been seen regularly.</p>\n<p>Petermann Island is named for geographer August Petermann and was discovered by a German expedition in 1873-74.<br />\n  During our landing, we will be able to observe rookeries of Adelie Penguins, Gentoo Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags. Petermann has various geological features, especially rock surfaces showing glacial polish and some glacial grooving.</p>\n<p>Pleneau Bay lies at the south end of the Lemaire Channel, and was first explored during Charcot’s 1903–05 French Antarctic Expedition. Gentoo Penguins, Kelp Gulls and South Polar Skuas are usually found breeding on Pleneau Island and Southern elephant seals are often hauled-out in wallows.<br />\n  Enjoy the spectacular scenery of icebergs nearby either from shore or during a Zodiac cruise.</p>\n<p><b>Day 9 — South Shetland Islands</b><br />\n  We will end our Antarctic sojourn in the South Shetland Islands. </p>\n<p>Port Foster, Whalers Bay and Telefon Bay are all located in Deception Island, an excellent example of a caldera that can be reached from the sea. We plan to sail into the caldera through the narrow entrance called Neptune’s Bellows. Ashore Deception Island’s interesting history -from whaling to scientific studies- still shows remains of a former whaling station, including the boilers used to make whale oil in the early 1900s, and houses belonging to a British research base. The unique volcanic features of the area can be seen during hikes.</p>\n<p>The Aitcho Islands have Gentoo and Chinstrap Penguin colonies. Southern Giant Petrels and skuas are never far from penguin rookeries and elephant seals quite often look for company near the landing site.</p>\n<p><b>Days 9–10 — Drake Passage</b><br />\n  Navigating our return through the Drake Passage, we will watch for seabirds and wildlife we may have missed on our initial crossing. There will be opportunities to attend additional presentations offered by the Expedition Team lecturers and to edit the many photos taken as we travel towards Ushuaia.<br />\n  During the last afternoon, our Photographer/Videographer will show the Voyage –DVD.</p>\n<p><b>Day 11 — Ushuaia, Argentina</b><br />\n  After breakfast, disembark <i>Silver Cloud.</i><br />\n</p>\n<p><i>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed.

These  kayak excursions have limited space; they require a certain level of fitness  and will also depend on local conditions for safe operation.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 — Ushuaia, Argentina </strong><br />\n  Embark <em>Silver Cloud</em> and meet some of your fellow travellers as you become  acquainted with the luxurious amenities found on board. After settling in a  mandatory safety drill will have to be attended. Later your Expedition Leader  will introduce some of the important crew members and your Expedition Team.  While we sail out of Ushuaia you will be able to see the many snow-covered  mountains lining the Beagle Channel and bid farewell to Tierra del Fuego. Enjoy  the spectacular scenery while we have our sail away cocktail on the open decks. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 2 —  At Sea</strong><br />\n  Gather in the Theatre Lounge to hear fascinating  tales of adventure and to learn about the Falkland Islands’ endemic wildlife  and remarkable nature. Our knowledgeable Lecture Staff members are experts in a  variety of scientific fields. Other onboard diversions include Spa treatments,  a workout in the Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 3 —&nbsp;&nbsp; Steeple Jason  Island, Falkland Islands </strong><br />\n  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; West  Point Island, Falkland Islands </strong><br />\n  Steeple Jason was used for  sheep-grazing until the 1980s, but never properly inhabited; therefore birdlife has been less disturbed and  includes&nbsp;Southern Rockhopper,&nbsp;Magellanic, and&nbsp;Gentoo Penguins,  Slender-billed Prions,&nbsp;caracaras&nbsp;and&nbsp;Blackish Cinclodes (known  locally as Tussac-Birds), as well as Black-browed Albatrosses. Roughly 70% of the world’s population  of Black-browed Albatrosses is said the breed on the Falkland Islands and Steeple  Jason has the largest colony. Sea lions and&nbsp;fur seals can be seen along the shore.<br />\n  <br />\n  In the afternoon, watch  for Peale’s dolphins and the distinctive black and white markings of the  Commerson’s dolphin as the <em>Silver  Cloud</em> approaches West Point Island. Upon arrival,  photographic opportunities are everywhere as you walk across rolling moorland  and admire a colony of Black-browed Albatrosses nesting side-by-side with  Rockhopper Penguins. <br />\n  The hospitable island owners are always  happy to answer your questions and share their stories. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 —  Stanley, Falkland Islands</strong><br />\n  Stanley has a distinct British ambience and we begin our day in the capital city of  the remote Falkland Islands by boarding a local bus for a ‘city tour’ with a  local guide. You can also stroll through the charming streets of this colourful  little town, lined with quaint cottages and a variety of traditional pubs.  Visit the 19th-century Anglican cathedral (the southernmost Anglican cathedral  in the world) and wander through the Falkland Islands Dockyard Museum. For  stamp collectors a visit to the Philatelic Bureau is a must. Walking along Ross  Road you will come to a monument to honour the victims of the  1982 Falklands conflict between Britain and Argentina. </p>\n<p><strong>Days  5–6 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Binoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to watch for  seabirds and whales. Attend  informative lectures that will prepare you for the upcoming visits in South  Georgia and the adventures that lie ahead. Peruse an array of titles and topics  in the well-stocked Library, enjoy the finest cigars and cognacs at the  Connoisseur’s Corner or indulge in any of the other special amenities offered  aboard <em>Silver Cloud</em>. </p>\n<p><strong>Days 6–10  — South Georgia </strong><br />\n  This breathtaking destination of towering snow-covered mountains,  mighty glaciers, and low-lying grasslands attracts an astounding concentration  of wildlife: Southern fur seals, Southern elephant seals and a variety of  albatross species including Black-browed, Light-mantled Sooty, Grey-headed and the  spectacular Wandering Albatross, plus thousands of King and hundreds of  Macaroni Penguins.</p>\n<p>South Georgia is also linked to the early Antarctic explorers.  Captain James Cook first stepped ashore in 1775, but perhaps more famous is  Ernest Shackleton’s arrival in 1916 following the sinking of his ship <em>Endurance</em>. Visit the graves of  Shackleton and Frank Wild and the whaling museum at Grytviken. </p>\n<p>Here  are some of the places we may visit: </p>\n<p><strong>Cooper  Bay </strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Go on a Zodiac cruise to see Macaroni and  Chinstrap Penguins on the rocks and in the water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Gold  Harbour</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A large King Penguin colony can be found  near Bertrab Glacier.</li>\n  <li>Seals can be seen resting and sunning on  the beaches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Grytviken</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A historic whaling station, all that  remains today are the rusted hulls of long abandoned sealing and whaling ships  and working sheds. </li>\n  <li>At the South Georgia Museum guests can  learn about past whaling techniques and view various exhibits on exploration  and discovery.</li>\n  <li>See the burial site of the famous explorer  Sir Ernest Shackleton.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Salisbury  Plain</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A favourite breeding ground for hundreds of  thousands of King Penguins; it is amazing to see how they completely cover the  beaches and hills.</li>\n  <li>In early March, the seal pups will be quite  active and aggressive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Days  11–13 — At Sea</strong><br />\n  As we cross the South Atlantic, leisurely days at sea are yours to  enjoy. Participate in discussions and onboard  activities led by the Expedition Team, relax in one of the lounges with that  book you have been meaning to read, and meet up with new friends for cocktails.  Before turning in for the night, take a stroll on deck to take in  the solitude of the vast sea and sky.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 14  — Gough Island, UK (Subject to government approval) </strong><br />\n  A dependency of&nbsp;Tristan da  Cunha&nbsp;and part of the&nbsp;British overseas territory&nbsp;of&nbsp;Saint  Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, Gough  Island was originally known as&nbsp;Gonçalo Álvares&nbsp;(the captain of Vasco da Gama’s flagship).  The&nbsp;volcanic island&nbsp;covers an area of 91 km² and is uninhabited  except for the personnel of a South African&nbsp;weather station&nbsp;on its  southeastern side.&nbsp; It is one of the most  remote places with a constant human presence.</p>\n<p>Gough Island is part of  the&nbsp;UNESCO&nbsp;World Heritage Site&nbsp;of&nbsp;Gough and Inaccessible  Islands, a protected wildlife reserve and an “Important Bird Area”.&nbsp; If conditions allow we will offer a Zodiac  cruise and look for Tristan Albatross, Atlantic Petrel, Gough Moorhen, Gough  Bunting, and Northern Rockhopper Penguins -some of the many birds using this  mid-Atlantic island as their nesting ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 15  — Tristan da Cunha, UK </strong><br />\n  Recognised as the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world,  its closest neighbouring landmass is the island of St. Helena some 2,430 km  away. The main island is home to 301 hardy residents (census March 2016). <br />\n  Weather and landing depending, we hope to enjoy guided walks with  the local inhabitants of Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, the main village on the  island’s north coast, while our onboard Geologist will lead a walk to the 1961  volcanic cone and lava flow. Learn how the islanders were evacuated and  how it affected their lives.&nbsp; Once at the  top, we will have a beautiful scenic view of the whole settlement – a photo  opportunity not to be missed. We will meet with some of the island children and  hear what Tristan life is like through their eyes during our visit to St Mary’s  School.&nbsp; Our  onboard Ornithologist will point out birdlife, hopefully including the Atlantic  Yellow-nosed Albatross, Sooty Albatross, Tristan Thrush, and Tristan Wandering  Albatross – a critically endangered species with fewer than 1,500 breeding  pairs left in the world. The archipelago is also where 90% of the world’s  Northern Rockhopper Penguins come to breed. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 16  — Nightingale Island, UK </strong><br />\n  Weather permitting; we hope to land on uninhabited Nightingale  Island, a protected wildlife reserve and World Heritage Site. You  will see the most magnificent wildlife, flora and fauna all unspoilt by people.  All guests will receive a certificate verifying that they have indeed visited  this extremely remote world destination.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Days  17–20 — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Enjoy a variety of onboard activities. The days at sea will be filled with educational lectures and  interesting entertainment options. All  accommodations feature an interactive television system allowing you to watch  your choice of movies or documentary films and even recorded broadcasts from  the Theatre Lounge in the comfort and privacy of your suite.<br />\n  On the last day your onboard Videographer will screen the  Voyage-DVD, letting you remember all those special moments during your voyage  from cape to cape.<br />\n  The Captain will invite you to his (your) Farewell Cocktail Party  and the Chef and Restaurant Manager want to surprise you with the special  Farewell Dinner. </p>\n<p><strong>Days  21–22 — Cape Town, South Africa</strong><br />\n  Arriving in the morning of Day 21 (27 March) you will be able to explore  the natural wonders of Cape Town.&nbsp; You  can choose to ascend Table Mountain by cable car and hike in the protected  area, having a look at the many endemic plants and animals. Later you will  travel by bus to Signal Hill for dramatic views over Table Bay and Cape  Town.&nbsp; Or you can go on an excursion to  see an African Penguin colony at Boulders Beach. The scenic drive to Boulders  Beach will go along the Atlantic seaboard and later will continue through the  prestigious suburbs of Bishopscourt and Constantia into the region where South  Africa’s wine industry began over 3 centuries ago. At one of the local wine  estates you will enjoy a formal wine tasting (paired with canapés). <br />\n  In the evening you are free to enjoy the unique opportunity to  explore the vibrant V &amp; A Waterfront in Cape Town Harbour on your own. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 22 — Cape Town, South Africa</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong></strong><br />\n  After  breakfast on Thursday, 28 March, disembark <em>Silver  Cloud</em>. </p>",

In 1908, a sparkling diamond was found among  the sand and the news spread like wildfire, causing fortune hunters to converge  in droves on Kolmanskop. When the town reached its pinnacle, Kolmanskop  developed into a lively little haven of German culture. When richer diamond  deposits were discovered further south operations were moved. Today it is  mostly a ghost town; the stately homes, abandoned decades ago, are gradually  becoming sand-covered. However, a museum has been established and a number of  buildings restored. While in Kolmanskop enjoy oyster tasting and a glass of  sparkling wine. <br />\n  After this eventful day in the Namib Desert it is time to head  back to Lüderitz for a short walking tour of the town and its three most  important landmarks, Goerke Haus, Felsenkirche and the Lüderitz Museum.</p>\n<p><strong>Days  4–5 — Walvis Bay, Namibia </strong></p>\n<div>\n  <p><strong>Scenic Dunes Flight</strong></p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">\n</span><h1><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Take  advantage of an unparalleled opportunity to see the famous Sossusvlei Dunes  from the air, a site very difficult to access by land. Following the (normally  dry) Kuiseb River, fly over Sesriem Canyon then along the Tsauchab river valley  where the freestanding but static dunes tower up to 250 metres above the plain.  The dune belt runs north to south for over 70 km between Sossusvlei and the  Atlantic. Upon reaching the coast, head north over deserted mining camps and  seal colonies to Conception Bay and the wreck of the <em>Eduard Bohlen</em> (run aground in the early 40s). This optional Silver Shore  excursion will operate only if weather/fog conditions permit. Visit  Silversea.com/MyVoyage to make reservations in advance of your voyage.</span></b></span></h1>\n</div>\n<p>One of your destinations  during our two days in Walvis Bay is the Namib Naukluft Park. Passing endless  waves of sand dunes, the scene that comes to mind when you think of African  deserts, you will finally enter the Welwitschia Drive, where the landscape is  dotted with the extraordinary <em>Welwitschia  mirabilis</em>. Unique to the Namibe Desert, this prehistoric plant has adapted  to its harsh habitat. It only produces two leaves in its lifetime which can be  over 500 years. After stopping to view and discuss these amazing and resilient  desert plants in their dramatic landscape, the tour continues to what can best  be described as ‘lunar landscape’. Enjoy the breathtaking views, before heading  onwards to a local community where you will enjoy an orientation tour of the  school, having the opportunity to interact by giving some of your time to the  children and community. </p>\n<p>You will then drive to a  pristine location where refreshments await you before returning to Walvis Bay  to rejoin the <em>Silver Cloud</em>.</p>\n<p>We will also be operating a  full day shuttle service to Swakopmund, located 19 miles north of Walvis Bay at  the mouth of the Swakop River. Upon arrival you can explore this quaint town, a  beach resort area and a fine example of German colonial architecture, on your  own. Founded in 1892 as the main harbor for German South-West Africa, a good  part of the population still speaks German today. Several buildings, including  the Magistrate’s Court, or Kaiserliches Bezirksgericht, the Lutheran Church and  the old Railway Station building -now the main reception area of the Swakopmund  Hotel- will give an idea of the former splendor.</p>\n<p>Another excursion in Walvis Bay will be an  early morning boat cruise in the protected outer lagoon area where the water is  calm and abundant with birdlife. Enjoy wonderful photographic opportunities as  playful Heaviside’s and bottlenose dolphins frolic around the boat and pelicans  fly low overhead. Cape fur seals may even come aboard for a fishy snack! Other birds  we will see include flamingos and cormorants. If we are very lucky, we may even  see leatherback turtles. We will pass fishing factories and foreign ships in  the port and conclude our excursion with a taste of fresh Walvis Bay oysters  and local ‘champagne’. &nbsp; <br />\n  <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />\n  <strong>Day 6 —  At Sea </strong><br />\n  Binoculars and camera in hand, head out on deck to watch for  seabirds and marine mammals. Attend  informative lectures that will prepare you for the upcoming ports-of-call in  Angola. Other onboard diversions include Spa treatments, a  workout in the Fitness Centre, and, of course, exquisite dining experiences  -not only in The Restaurant, The Grill and La Terrazza, but also as cooking  demonstrations. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 7 —  Namibe, Angola </strong><br />\n  Today we will head out to the Namibe Desert looking for <em>Welwitschia mirabili</em>s, an endemic plant  found only in the Namibe Province of South Angola and the Namib Desert. Continuing  through desert landscape we will reach The Arch Lagoon -“the lost oasis”. The lagoon,  locally known as “Lago do Arco do Carvalhao”, is formed by a magnificent rock  formation, and is a unique display of art in nature. The lagoon will only have  water if it has rained sufficiently during the wet season. </p>\n<p>Before returning to the ship, we will visit the little town of  Namibe to visit the old city with its baroque architecture, old stadium and  churches.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 8 —  Lobito, Angola</strong><br />\n  The city of Benguela was founded in 1617 around Sao Filipe  Fortress and was one of the bases for Portuguese expansion in Africa. We will  drive through the city to the most famous church in Benguela. The “Igreja do Populo”  was built by the Portuguese during the colonial era, being the first stone  building in southern Angola. From there we will walk to the heart of Benguela City,  where the courthouse surrounds the company gardens, the department of justice  and the town hall. The gardens are lined with beautiful palm trees and flowers  and offer a picturesque setting.<br />\n  En route back to Lobito we will stop at the city of Catumbela and  will stop at the abandoned Sao Pedro fort for some photos, and will see the big  Catumbela River and the 1905 steel bridge –a construction by Eiffel’s engineering  company, which was in use until 2010.</p>\n<p>Once back at the pier there will be a festival with traditional  dances and singing.</p>\n<p>During the afternoon we will be on our way sailing north, having  time for more lectures and other on-board activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 9 —  Luanda, Angola</strong><br />\n  Luanda is the capital of Angola, and home  to more than four million, making it one of the largest Portuguese speaking  cities in the world. </p>\n<p>This bustling city presents us with many  places to explore, including the 1575 Fortress of Sao Miguel de Luanda with its  striking blue tiles and collection of weapons used during centuries of  conflicts of the region. Another ‘outstanding’ structure is the mausoleum for  Angola’s first president, Agostinho Neto. The anthropology museum houses an  array of traditional masks along with art, sculptures, tools, and weaponry, as  well as jewellery, clothing and musical instruments – the Benfica market seems  to have several similar items for barter and sale. We will  also drive to Cidade Alta, or “Uptown” – a pleasant, airy and calm suburb with  several pink colonial buildings and then head to the Baixa, or “Downtown”, to  view the Houses of Parliament – both new and old. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Days 10-11  — At Sea </strong><br />\n  Participate in onboard activities, relax in one of the lounges, or  peruse an array of titles and topics in the well-stocked Library. Let our  onboard Ornithologist give you a glimpse of the fascinating birds of Sao Tome  and Principe. King Neptune might want all ‘pollywogs’ to pay homage to the  ruler of the seas before <em>Silver Cloud</em> crosses the Equator. </p>\n<p>Take a stroll on deck and enjoy the solitude and splendour of the  vast sea and at night see if you can already notice the stars and  constellations of the northern hemisphere’s sky.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 12 — </strong><strong>São Tomé, São Tomé and  Príncipe</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  <em>Silver  Cloud</em> drops anchor this morning off the island of São Tomé. We plan to use our  Zodiacs to go ashore and start our tours of Sao Tome, the capital city to the  islands of Sao Tome and Principe and the surroundings. </p>\n<p>One of the stops will be at the impressive São Nicolãu  waterfall, which not only invites to have a swim in its pool, but also is  surrounded by mossy rocks, covered in liverworts, ferns, wild raspberries and  impatiens that will delight botany lovers. We continue our tour higher into the  mountains to the Monte Café coffee plantation, where we will be given a tour of  the coffee processing facilities –obviously tasting some of the local coffee as  well.</p>\n<p>A typical lunch will be served at another plantation  before returning to the city centre with its colonial architecture including  the pink and white presidential palace, the 16th century Cathedral de São Tome,  as well as Faro São Sebastião, which now is the São Tome National Museum. We will  stroll through the city streets en route to the local market.</p>\n<p>For those who would like to explore other aspects of  the island of São Tome on their own, a half day tour of the city of São Tome  will be offered, giving time for some independent exploration.</p>\n<p>In the evening <em>Silver  Cloud</em> will set sail for Principe and Bom Bom Island.</p>\n<p><strong>Day  13 — Bom Bom Island, São Tomé and Principe</strong><br />\n  This  morning we will go ashore at Bom Bom Island, just offshore from ‘mainland’  Principe’s north coast, to either enjoy the beaches and the facilities of the  Bom Bom Resort, or to walk towards Santo Antonio, Principe’s main town.</p>\n<p>Our  onboard Ornithologist and naturalists will lead walks to explore the island’s  wildlife and scenery –others might decide to walk all the way to sleepy Santo  Antonio passing small fields of plantain, cacao and manioc and watching the  daily life of this tropical island.</p>\n<p>If  you prefer to stay at the resort you can take kayaks to paddle along the shore  or snorkel in the clear waters, looking for colourful fishes.</p>\n<p>In  the afternoon, <em>Silver Cloud</em> will set  sail for Limbe and our onboard Historian might enlighten you about the German  influence in Cameroon during the Briefing &amp; Recap. </p>\n<p><strong>Day  14 — Limbe, Cameroon</strong><br />\n  We  start our tour after taking the Zodiacs ashore to visit Limbe in the northern  region at the foot of Mt. Cameroon. Our first stop is the Limbe Botanical  Gardens founded by Germans in 1892. It served as a trials and acclimatisation  centre for the introduction of exotic crop species such as coffee, cocoa,  rubber, oil palm, banana, teak and sugarcane for distribution within  \"Kamerun\" and other German colonies. In its heyday it was said to be  one of the most important tropical botanic gardens in the world.</p>\n<p>We  will also visit the “Jungle Village” for a cultural presentation of various dances  from all over Cameroon. Cameroonians are famed for their skilled wood carvings  including masks, and Silversea has arranged for various craftsmen to come to  display and sell their goods today. This unique opportunity will permit you to  purchase some very unusual souvenirs. </p>\n<p>We  will also visit the Limbe Wildlife Centre. This is home to&nbsp;some&nbsp;critically  endangered wildlife species&nbsp;and we will have the opportunity to see a  variety of primate species including Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees, drill monkeys,  western lowland and Cross River gorillas,&nbsp;plus several species of  long-tailed monkeys such as the locally endemic Preuss’s guenon. During a short  lecture we will learn more about the centre’s work as well as their struggles  and successes in educating the local population on the importance of  conservation. </p>\n<p>For  those bent on getting closer to Mount Cameroon, a drive to Buea, the former  capital of German Cameroon, and the Mount Cameroon National Park with a hike on  its lower slopes through forest and savanna awaits.</p>\n<p><em>Silver Cloud </em>will set  sail for Cotonou, Benin in the evening. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 15  — At Sea </strong><br />\n  This leisurely day at sea is yours to enjoy. Participate in discussions and onboard  activities led by the Expedition Team. Attend lectures about Benin and Togo and  their role in the infamous slave trade or relax in one of the lounges with that  book you’ve been meaning to read, and meet up with new friends for cocktails. Perhaps  a wine seminar or teatime’s Team Trivia will call your attention. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 16  — Cotonou, Benin</strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Cloud </em>will dock this  morning at Cotonou, Benin, referred to by many as the ‘Latin Quarter of  Africa’. Today’s full day tour will head out on tour to Ouidah and Lake Nokoue. </p>\n<p>The town of Ouidah is known as the religious capital  of the country due to the numerous festivals with singing, chanting, drumming  and dances that take place here. Historically, Ouidah was also one of the  busiest of the West African slave embarkation points. We will walk along the  “Route des Esclaves” down to the shoreline where there is an imposing arch with  bas-relief sculpture to memorialise the people who were shipped out from here. An  unusual feature of Ouidah is the Sacred Forest of Kpasse with its Python Temple  and voodoo statues which we will visit, as well as the small local museum.<br />\n  We will also travel to Lake Nokoue where we will board  small motorboats to visit Ganvié, a fishing village made up of bamboo houses  resting on teak stilts, perched above the water. The village was founded more  than 200 years ago when Tofinou people fled to the lake to escape slave  raiders. All travel between homes is done in wooden boats on the waterways that  separate them. We will have the chance to see the floating market, before we go  ‘ashore’ at one of the houses to see a mesmerizing presentation by <em>Egungun</em> dancers. <br />\n  Lunch will be had at a beach resort.</p>\n<p>Birders will be looking for Whiskered Terns, Little  Egrets, Yellow-billed Kites and Pied Kingfishers. </p>\n<p><strong>Days  17-18 — Lomé, Togo </strong><br />\n  <em>Silver Cloud</em> will dock early in  the morning and we will head out for tours of Togo’s hinterland.</p>\n<p>We start one of our tours driving through the old  colonial town with its modern-looking independence square before reaching one  of the many museums and one of the markets for a look at the old and modern  life of Togo.</p>\n<p>Another of the tours will head for Ewe village, where  we will be welcomed by traditional dancers and the local school children. This  will be one of the best opportunities to learn about village life in Togo and  to hand over your contribution of school supplies. Fascinating fabrics will be  on sale and you will be able to see how they are prepared locally. Heading  further north we will reach Kloto forest and divide into smaller groups to  learn about the medicinal and commercial plants found in and near the secondary  forest. During lunch local musicians and dancers will entertain us, and  souvenirs will be on offer nearby.</p>\n<p>You will also have the unique opportunity to partake  in a voodoo ceremony –or at least to have a look at how these ceremonies take  place when we are invited in one of the suburbs to see this practice.</p>\n<p>Our onboard Videographer/Photographer will present the  Voyage-DVD recounting the many different sites and encounters of our West  African voyage. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Day 19 — Accra, Ghana</strong><br />\n  Following  breakfast on board, we disembark <em>Silver Cloud</em> in Tema, Ghana’s largest seaport and Accra’s harbour. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Expedition  highlights and wildlife listed here are possible experiences only and cannot be  guaranteed. Your Expedition Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities  for adventure and exploration are the best possible, taking into account the  prevailing weather and wildlife activity. Expedition Team members as well as  guest speakers and their lecture topics scheduled for this voyage are subject  to change or cancellation without notice.</em><br />\n</p>\n<br clear=\"all\" />\n<p align=\"center\">IMPORTANT INFORMATION </p>\n<p><strong>Inoculations</strong><br />\n  You will need to have a valid Yellow  Fever Certificate in order to board this expedition. Local authorities will not  allow us to embark any person without this certificate. As we are travelling  through some malaria areas you will want to consult with your local medical  practitioner or travel clinic regarding the need for malaria prophylaxes. </p>\n<p><strong>Passports </strong><br />\n  Your passport will need at least two  completely empty, side-by-side pages for entry into South Africa. You might be  denied entry into South Africa should you not have this. </p>\n<p><strong>Visas</strong> <br />\n  You will require visas for all of the  countries visited during this expedition. Silversea has made arrangements with  local authorities for visas to be issued upon arrival in each port. Your  shipboard account will be charged with the fees charged to us. (Visas will cost  approximately USD$30 to USD$50 per person, per port.) </p>\n<p><strong>Clothing</strong><br />\n  When packing, you will want to bring  lightweight, sensible clothing to wear ashore, and remember to leave any  jewellery or other valuables safe on board in your suite. It may be best to  just leave these items at home. Visit our online retail partner Ship to Shore  at www.shiptoshore.com for a comprehensive list of suggested items for your  West Africa expedition. </p>\n<p><strong>Money </strong><br />\n  Before leaving home, make sure to  change some money and break larger bills so that you have all small dollar and  euro bills. Coins and large bills will be useless; ATMs/Cashpoints are few and  often not functional.</p>\n<p><strong>School Donations</strong> <br />\n  We also encourage you to bring a  donation of school supplies or second-hand children’s clothing for our visits  to local villages. Much-needed supplies include pens, pencils and writing  tablets. Supplies will be collected on board by the Expedition Team and  distributed on your behalf during the voyage.</p>\n<p><strong>Local Guides</strong><br />\n  Though none of the countries we visit  provide a formal qualification for tour group guides, we do hire local guides  in order to support the local community. It is also important to remember that  among the thousands of languages spoken in Africa, local guides often speak  English only as a <em>lingua franca</em> – a  common language learned in order for speakers of different native languages to  better communicate with each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Photography</strong><br />\n  Please ask your guide’s advice first  before taking any photographs. Some of the international embassies and  government buildings that we may see during our time ashore may be deemed as  military or state defence objects, and thus photography is not allowed. Ignoring  these rules can be considered a serious offence.</p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong><br />\n  In the western regions of Africa, the  general infrastructure varies from fine to fair to, well … lacking. Roads are  not always smooth or clear of debris and when we use local transportation, it  will be the best available, but this may not be saying much.</p>",

        "voyage_highlights": "<p><strong>Day 1 — Honiara, Solomon Islands</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Embark the&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer</em>&nbsp;for this stunning Silversea  Expedition – Treasures of Melanesia. This afternoon, you will be introduced to  your Expedition Team and attend a safety briefing. Tonight we invite you to  familiarize yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your  fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The  Restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Day&nbsp;2 — Lumalihe Island, Marovo Lagoon, Solomon  Islands</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Marovo Lagoon has been described  by American author James A. Michener as “one of the seven natural wonders of  the world”, Marovo is home to a double barrier reef system, and is one of two  sites in the Solomon’s currently under consideration for UNESCO World Heritage  Site status.<br />\n  Though residents of Marovo Lagoon  normally do not dance, we hope to see some demonstration of local handicraft,  and hear some of their songs.<br />\n  Diving or snorkelling close to  the entrance of the lagoon will expose incredible reef drop-offs that are  characterised by gorgonian fan forests, black coral gardens, giant clams, sea  turtles, manta rays, eels, barracuda, octopus, morays, grey whaler sharks (also  known as grey reef sharks), lionfish and shoals of pelagic fish. <br />\n  Meanwhile, bird-watchers can look  for Osprey, Brahminy Kite and kingfisher in the forests on one of the many  surrounding islands.<br />\n  The Marovo Lagoon residents are  quite famous for their woodcarvings and we hope to see some of the intricately  carved and adorned artefacts –hoping to be able to buy some as well.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 3 — Roderick Bay, Solomon Islands</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n  Be out on deck in the early  morning as we approach the Sandfly Passage to reach Roderick Bay, located between  Mbokonimbeti Island and Nggela Sule (in the Florida Islands). <br />\n  Once we reach the bay, you will  see that huge trees give shade and a picture-perfect little beach will invite  you to swim and snorkel, while the extensive coral reef ecosystems, teeming  tropical fish and exceptional dive sites beckon our divers as well. The  snorkelling might show feather stars and colourful nudibranches, vase sponges  and gorgonian fans, lionfish and octopus -all part of this truly remarkable marine  environment.<br />\n  If conditions permit, our Galley  Team will want to offer a barbecue ashore.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 — Port Mary, Santa Ana, Solomon Islands</strong><br />\n  Today <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will enter Port Mary, the bay in front of  Ghupuna, Santa Ana’s main village. We will have a short Zodiac ride onto a  beautiful white sand beach with huge shade-giving trees. Once ashore you will  notice the very tidy village with its houses made of local materials built on  stilts. <br />\n  After a short welcome on the  beach we will head to the sports ground where we will be entertained by  traditional songs and dances by members of the three different villages on  Santa Ana (Owaraha in the local language). <br />\n  Islanders will have set up  several stands with souvenirs, ranging from traditional shell money to fishing  floats and different carvings based on local stories and legends. <br />\n  In the afternoon, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will continue  eastward. Let our lecturers introduce you to our next destination. </p>\n<p><strong>Day 5 — Nembao Village, Utupua Island, Solomon Islands</strong><br />\n  This morning, <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will enter the deep  bay on Utupua’s western side. Nembao, one of the main villages on the island,  will be our host this day. After a Zodiac ride, we will land on the sandy beach  next to the village’s centre.<br />\n  We will be welcomed and attend a  presentation of traditional dances and songs. <br />\n  A good way to have a look at how  these Solomon Islanders live is to walk along the beach and look at the houses,  fishing canoes and small plantations.&nbsp; If  tide and time permits we might take our Zodiacs to explore the mangrove-lined  shores further into the bay looking for birdlife and mudskippers.</p>\n<p><strong>Day 6 — Champagne Beach, Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu</strong><br />\n  During the morning <em>Silver Discoverer </em>will approach Espiritu  Santo, Vanuatu’s largest island. The European name goes back to the early 17th  century when Pedro de Quiroz believed to have reached the famous “Tierra  Australis Incognita”, the unknown southern land, which he called “La Austrialia  del Espiritu Santo”.<br />\n  We will pass Big Bay, where the  Spaniards tried to settle, to reach Hog Harbor and Champagne Beach. Once we  will have cleared into Vanuatu, you will be able to enjoy one of the finest  beaches of Vanuatu. You can relax under huge Barringtonia trees and Alexandrian  laurel giving cooling shade or swim and snorkel in the crystal-clear water. <br />\n  We hope to see and hear one of  the most unusual music groups of Vanuatu –the Water Music Women. Standing in a  half-circle in the water, they produce their music using the hands, moving them  through the water in different ways.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Day 7 — Ambrym, Vanuatu</strong><br />\n  In the early morning <em>Silver Discoverer</em> will be in front of  Ambrym’s west coast. Unlike Espiritu Santo with its raised coral reefs and  white sand, Ambrym is a volcanic and active (!) island with dark beaches. <br />\n  Ambrym is known as the island of  magic and of the 113 local language of Vanuatu 5 alone are spoken on Ambrym  –apart from Bislama, one of the three official languages of the country. <br />\n  We will go ashore in Ranon to  have a look at the local community and see the very special Rom dance. Normally  these dances are only shown during grade-taking ceremonies or men’s secret  society meetings and on those occasions the participants actually prepare their  masks and costumes in secrecy.<br />\n  Apart from the mesmerizing Rom  dance we will be entertained by one of the local string bands and hope to see  some of Vanuatu’s sand drawings. Although some might simply see them as  aesthetically pleasing drawings, UNESCO has recognised them as a local  “writing” system and inscribed them on the Representative List of Intangible  Cultural Heritage of Humanity.<br />\n  Our  onboard Photographer/Videographer will present the Voyage-DVD, permitting you  to relive the many moments of encounters with the local communities, the  excursions taken and the animals and plants seen above and in the water.<br />\n  <strong>Day 8 — Port Vila,  Vanuatu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> <br />\n  Following breakfast, disembark&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer.</em><br />\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\n  <em>Expedition highlights and wildlife listed  here are possible experiences only and cannot be guaranteed. Your Expedition  Leader and Captain will work together to ensure opportunities for adventure and  exploration are the best possible, taking into account the prevailing weather  and wildlife activity. Expedition Team members scheduled for this voyage are  subject to change or cancellation.</em></p>\n<p><strong>360 DEGREES OF GIVING</strong> <br />\n  They  say it’s better to give than to receive, luckily we have the opportunity to do  both. The friendly villagers we visit throughout our expedition welcome us with  such warm hearts, and we receive so much from them, that we want to make sure  we’re giving right back.<br />\n  In  the spirit of goodwill, we greatly encourage you to help us support the local  communities we will be visiting. Gifts may consist of second-hand children’s  clothing, school supplies (pencils, pens, and writing tablets), and medical  supplies (Band-Aids, antiseptic wipes, and first aid items). Supplies received  will be collected on board by the Expedition Team and evenly distributed  throughout the villages as we visit.</p><p><br />\n  <strong>ARE YOU A CERTIFIED DIVER?</strong> <br />\n  This  Silversea voyage features an optional Dive Programme that visits several  different dive sites throughout the itinerary. If you wish to participate in  scuba diving excursions, here’s what you need to know.<br />\n  <strong>You must:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Be an advanced scuba diver.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Be fully certified.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Provide proof before embarking the Silver Discoverer.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Have medical dive travel insurance.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Bring your own gear like Scuba BCDs and regulators (we  will provide weight belts and tanks).&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Snorkelling  is available for non-divers.
